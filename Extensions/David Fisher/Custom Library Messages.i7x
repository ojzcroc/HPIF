   add the custom library messages.

To add the custom library messages:
   repeat through the table of custom library messages begin;
      set the message id entry to the message text entry;
   end repeat.

To set (id_ - library message id) to (msg_ - text):
   update the row with id of id_ to msg_.

[ perform a binary search to quickly find the message id
  (table is guaranteed to be sorted) ]

To update the row with id of (id_ - library message id) to (msg_ - text):
   let n1 be 1;
   let n2 be the number of rows in the table of library messages;
   while n1 <= n2 begin;
      let mid be n1 plus n2;
	  change mid to mid divided by 2;
	  choose row mid in the table of library messages;
	  if the message id entry is id_ begin;
	     change the message text entry to msg_;
		 change n1 to n2 + 1;	[ to force the loop to stop ]
	  end if;
	  if the message id entry < id_, change n1 to mid plus 1;
      if the message id entry > id_, change n2 to mid minus 1;
   end while.

libmsg_3ps_changed is a number that varies. libmsg_3ps_changed is 0.

To set the library message third person text to (name_ - text):
	set the library message third person text to name_ / name_ / name_.

To set the library message third person text to (upper_ - text) / (lower_ - text):
   set the library message third person text to upper_ / lower_ / lower_.

To restore the library message third person text:
   set the library message third person text to "He" / "he" / "him";
   change libmsg_3ps_changed to 0.

To set the library message third person text to (upper_ - text) / (lower_ - text) / (dobj_ - text):
   change libmsg_3ps_changed to 1;
   repeat through the table of 'you' forms begin;
      if Gramm Person entry is third person and
	     Gramm Number entry is singular begin;
		 if Case entry is upper-case, change Word entry to upper_;
         otherwise change Word entry to lower_;
	  end if;
   end repeat;
   repeat through the table of 'you' dobj forms begin;
      if Gramm Person entry is third person and
	     Gramm Number entry is singular then
      change Word entry to dobj_;
   end repeat.

Part 3 - Implementation

Section 3.1 - Kinds - unindexed

[ upper and lower case ]

Letter case is a kind of value.
The letter cases are lower-case and upper-case.

Section 3.2 - The current object - unindexed

curr_obj is an object that varies.
curr_obj_inform6_value is an object that varies.

[ The current tense, number, person and gender for curr_obj;
  if curr_obj = the player, these are equal to the library message values,
  otherwise curr_obj_number is third person and the number and gender are
  determined by the object. ]

temporary_tense is a tense that varies.
use_temporary_tense is a truth state that varies.
use_temporary_tense is false.
curr_obj_number is a grammatical number that varies.
curr_obj_person is a grammatical person that varies.
curr_obj_gender is a gender that varies.

[ the subject of the sentence, initially assumed to be the actor ]

curr_subject is an object that varies.

[ change the current object ]

To set the current object to (x_ - an object) / (dbg_msg - text):
   if the main object is nothing, change the main object to the noun;
   if x_ is_nothing, change curr_obj to main object;	[ make sure it is always valid ]
   otherwise change curr_obj to x_;
   if curr_obj is_nothing, change curr_obj to the player; [last resort]
   if library_message_debug is on begin;
      say "{[dbg_msg]:obj=";
      if curr_obj is the player, say "player"; [infinite recursion if prints player!]
      otherwise say "[curr_obj]";
      say "}";
   end if;
   if curr_obj is the player or curr_obj is_nothing, use the player's GNP;
   otherwise use the object's GNP.

To use the player's GNP:
   change curr_obj_person to the library message person;
   change curr_obj_number to the library message grammatical number;
   change curr_obj_gender to the library message gender.

To use the object's GNP:
   change curr_obj_person to third person;
   if curr_obj acts plural, change curr_obj_number to plural;
   otherwise change curr_obj_number to singular;
   change curr_obj_gender to the gender of curr_obj.

To decide which gender is the gender of (x_ - an object):
   if x_ acts feminine, decide on gender feminine;
   if x_ acts neuter, decide on gender neuter;
   decide on gender masculine.

To decide whether (x_ - an object) is_nothing:
   (- {x_} == nothing -).

This is the get the curr_obj from Inform 6 rule:
   set the current object to curr_obj_inform6_value / "I6".

To say current object is (x_ - an object):
   set the current object to x_ / "say curr obj".

To make sure main object is set / (dbg_msg - text):
   if main object is nothing, change main object to the noun;
   set the current object to the main object / dbg_msg.

[ called from Inform 6 ]

This is the internal make main object the current object rule:
  set the current object to the main object / "internal".

Include (-
[ set_curr_obj x;
  (+curr_obj_inform6_value+) = x;
  (+get the curr_obj from Inform 6 rule+)();   ! notify Inform 7 about the change
];
-)

Section 3.3 - "Say object" rules

To say => present tense:
   change temporary_tense to present tense;
   change use_temporary_tense to true.

To say => past tense:
   change temporary_tense to past tense;
   change use_temporary_tense to true.

To say => default tense:
   change temporary_tense to the library message tense;
   change use_temporary_tense to false.

To say => %:
   set the current object to the main object / "=>%".

To say => actor:
   set the current object to the person asked / "=>actor".

[ same as saying "[current object is ...]" ]

To say => (obj_ - an object):
   set the current object to obj_ / "=>".

To say % => (obj_ - an object):
   change the main object to obj_;
   set the current object to the main object / "%=>".

To say %:
   make sure main object is set / "%";
   if the main object is the player, say "[you]";
   otherwise say "[main object]".

To say the %:
   make sure main object is set / "the %";
   if the main object is the player, say "[you]";
   otherwise say "[the main object]".

To say The %:
   make sure main object is set / "The %";
   if the main object is the player, say "[You]";
   otherwise say "[The main object]";
   change curr_subject to the main object.

To say the % dobj:
   make sure main object is set / "the % dobj";
   if the main object is the player, say "[you|yourself]";
   otherwise say "[the main object]".

To say % dobj:
   make sure main object is set / "% dobj";
   if the main object is the player, say "[you|yourself]";
   otherwise say "[main object]".

To say inform 6 short name of %:
   make sure main object is set / "I6 %";
   if the main object is the player, say "[you]";
   otherwise say "[main object]".   [ probably wrong; Inform 6 uses print_obj to print this ]

To say The $:
   if curr_obj is the player, say "[You]";
   otherwise say "[The curr_obj]";
   change curr_subject to curr_obj.

To say the $:
   if curr_obj is the player, say "[you]";
   otherwise say "[the curr_obj]".

To say $:
   if curr_obj is the player, say "[you]";
   otherwise say "[curr_obj]".

To say $ dobj:
   if curr_obj is the player, say "[you|yourself]";
   otherwise say "[curr_obj]".

To say the $ dobj:
   if curr_obj is the player, say "[you|yourself]";
   otherwise say "[the curr_obj]".

To say The actor:
   say "[=> actor][The $]".
To say the actor:
   say "[=> actor][the $]".

This is the print library message rule:
   change libmsg-was-empty to 1;
   let n1 be 1;
   let n2 be the number of rows in the table of library messages;
   while n1 <= n2 begin;
      let mid be n1 plus n2;
	  change mid to mid divided by 2;
	  choose row mid in the table of library messages;

	     if the message text entry is not "" begin;
		    say the message text entry;
			change libmsg-was-empty to 0;

To init library messages:

[
  The following I6 code (in InitLibraryMessages) does not compile under
  Glulx (it says "Illegal backpatch marker in forward-declared symbol").

  It was originally added in version 6 to prevent infinite
  recursion when pushing an object between rooms; the Standard Rules
  file says:

     Include (- with before [; PushDir: AllowPushDir(); rtrue; ]
     ... -) when defining a thing

  - which caused problems when defining the I7_LibraryMessages
  object, and so the code below removed all "befores" other than
  LibraryMessagesBefore.

  To make a long story short ... the original PushDir problem seems
  to have gone away, but I am still suspicious, so I'll leave it in
  when compiling to Z code.

Part 5 - Rule handling - unindexed

Section 5.1 - Reporting rules - unindexed

To display (id_ - a library message id):
   display_part_1 for id_;
   follow the after library messages rule;
   display_part_2.

To display (id_ - a library message id) without 'after library messages':
   display_part_1 for id_;
   display_part_2.

To display_part_1 for (id_ - a library message id):
   change curr_subject to the person asked;	[ "actor" in Inform 6 ]
   change main object to the noun;
   set the current object to the main object / "set up";
   change library-message-id to id_;
   abide by the before library messages rule;
   follow the print library message rule.

To display_part_2:
   set_to_nothing main object;
   if libmsg-was-empty is 0 begin;
      if library-message-id is not LibMsg <reveal any newly visible exterior initial text>,
         say "[if there are not multiple objects][/n]";
   end if.

To set_to_nothing (x_ - an object):
   (- {x_} = nothing; -).

Section 5.2 - Internal rules - unindexed

[ the following rule is called from the i6 code ]

This is the custom_internal_i6 reveal any newly visible exterior rule:
   display LibMsg <reveal any newly visible exterior initial text> without 'after library messages';
   if there is no newly visible exterior begin;
       follow the after library messages rule;
       display LibMsg <no newly visible exterior>;
   otherwise;
       say ".[/r]";
       follow the after library messages rule;
       say "[/n]";
   end if.

[ need to test the return value of WriteListFrom(); not sure how to do this in Inform 7 ]
To decide whether there is no newly visible exterior:
   (- WriteListFrom(child(lm_o), ENGLISH_BIT+TERSE_BIT+CONCEAL_BIT) == 0 -).

[ Special handling for "go" without a direction ]

The block vaguely going rule is not listed in the for supplying a missing noun rules.

Rule for supplying a missing noun while going:
   display LibMsg <block vaguely going>;
   say " ".		[ if this isn't here, it says "You must supply a noun" ! ]

Section 5.3 - Locale description - unindexed

[ The following code was supplied by Emily Short ]

The you can see more rule is listed instead of the you-can-also-see 
rule in the for printing the locale description rules. 


For printing the locale description (this is the you can see more

Section: Overview

This extension allows you to replace the default Inform library messages in a simple and consistent way. It is also possible to change the point of view of the PC (to "I" instead of "you", for example).

A cut-down version called "Default Messages" is also available which contains no custom messages at all; all replacement library messages must be supplied. If you are using the standard PC point of view ("you") and do not need all of the functionality provided here, that extension may be preferable for you to use.

(See the Change History section below for a list of changes between versions).

Section: A Little Grammar

It is possible to change the tense, person, number and gender of
the standard library messages with this extension. A reminder of
what each of these terms mean:

"Tense" is to do with time. "He eats" is in the present tense;
"He ate" is in the past tense. Future tense is not handled in
this extension.

"Person" is to do with the point of view of the speaker. Some examples:

	First person - "I eat", "We eat"
	Second person - "You eat"
	Third person - "He/she/it eats", "They eat"

"Number" is either singular (one thing) or plural (more than one).

"Gender" is either masculine, feminine or neuter. This only makes
a difference for the third person singular ("he/she/it eats").

Changing these values is simple:

	When play begins:
   		change the library message tense to past tense;
   		change the library message person to third person;
   		change the library message grammatical number to singular;
   		change the library message gender to gender feminine.

This will cause the library message "You can't go that way" to become
"She couldn't go that way", and so on.

These values may be changed at any time during the game, not just at the beginning.

Section: Setting The Character's Name

As well as changing the library messages to say "you", "they", etc. it is also possible to set this text to the name of the character:

	When play begins:
		change the library message person to third person;
		set the library message third person text to "George".

If there are different forms for upper and lower case, say the following instead:

	When play begins:
		change the library message person to third person;
		set the library message third person text to "The mouse" / "the mouse".

You may also want to add a line like the following, just in case the player refers to the PC by name:

	Understand "George" as yourself.

For a female or neuter character, you should also say something like:

	change the library message gender to gender feminine

If it is ever necessary to change the library messages back to normal ("he", "him", etc), say:

	restore the library message third person text

Section: The "Examine me" Text

The response to "examine me" is not controlled by this extension (it used to be, before version 16). To set the "x me" text, do the following:

	The description of the player is "A small grey toad."

Section: Changing Library Messages

This extension has at its heart a table of library messages.

Including something like the following somewhere in your code will
automatically change the library messages to your own definitions:

	Table of custom library messages (continued)
	Message Id							Message Text
	LibMsg <confirm Quit>				"Really quit...?"
	...

You can also change a library message after the game has already started:

	set LibMsg <confirm Quit> to "Really quit...?"

For a complete list of messages and their initial values, see the
section "Messages" at the end of this documentation. The example in
the section "Before And After Library Messages" below may also be
helpful for identifying the id for a particular message.

Although only a single string is permitted for the Message Text,
it is still possible to add more lengthy conditions by defining
a special "say" rule:

	set LibMsg <confirm Quit> to "[quit msg]"

	To say quit msg:
		...
		...

Section: More Complex Messages

Most of the library messages refer to the player and/or an object;
for example:
	
	"You can't go that way."
	"The box isn't open."
	"First you'll have to close the box."

The above messages are defined as follows:

	"[You] [can't] go that way."
	"[The %] [isn't|aren't] open."
	"First [you]'ll have to close [the % dobj]."

"[You]" prints the appropriate pronoun for the player, which is usually
just "you", but can also be changed to "I", "he", "they", etc.

"[can't]" prints the word "can't" in the present tense or "couldn't" in
the past tense.

"%" represents the main object being talked about. "[The %]" will print
the same kind of thing as "[The x]" in standard Inform. You can also
say "[the %]" or just "[%]". If it is not the subject of the sentence -
as in the third example above - say "[% dobj]" or "[the % dobj]" instead
(dobj stands for "direct object", the alternative to being the subject
of the sentence).

"[isn't|aren't]" prints the appropriate word for the last thing mentioned
in the sentence. In the second example above, the last thing mentioned was
"%" (the main object), so it will say "isn't" if the main object is singular
or "aren't" if it is plural.

As well as "[the %]", it is possible to say "[The actor]" / "[the actor]",
which refers to the person doing the action (usually the player).

A list of commands is given below (see the section on
Auxiliary Verbs below for an explanation of "+" after a command).

	% ... ^The % ... the % ... % dobj ... the % dobj
	$ ... ^The $ ... the $ ... $ dobj ... the $ dobj ... ^The actor ... the actor
	^Are ... ^Aren't ... ^Can ... ^Can't ... ^Do ... ^Doesn't|Don't ... ^Does|Do ...  ^Don't
	^Hasn't|Haven't ... ^Has|Have ... ^Have ... ^Have+ ... ^Haven't ... ^Haven't+
	^He ... here ... ^Him ... ^Himself ... ^His ...
	^Isn't|Aren't ... ^Isn't|Wasn't ... ^Is|Are ... ^Is|Was
	^It's ... ^It|They ... ^It|Those ... ^That's|They're ... ^That|They ... ^That|Those
	^There's ... ^You ... ^You're ... ^You've+ ... ^Your ... ^Yourself
	are ... aren't ... can ... can't ... comes|came ... did ... didn't ... do ... doesn't|don't
	does|do ... don't ... hasn't|haven't ... has|have ... have ... have+ ... haven't ... haven't+
	he ... him ... himself ... -his ... is ... isn't|aren't ... isn't|wasn't ... is|are ... is|was
	it's ... it|them ... it|they ... it|those ... that|those ... there's ... you ... you dobj
	you|yourself ... you're ... you've+ ... your ... yourself

(Note that as of version 12, "[-his]" is used instead of "[his]"; see Change History).

The following commands are used to distinguish between a
supporter and a container:

	^On|In ... off|out of ... onto|into ... on|in

Section: Handling Verbs

In English, verb endings change depending on the subject; for example,
"He eats" vs "I eat".

To handle this properly in a library message, use the "[-s]", "[-es]"
or "[e-s]" commands:

	"[You] lack[-s] the dexterity."
	"[The actor] search[-es] [the % dobj]."
	"[You] tast[e-s] nothing unexpected."

"[-s]" will add an "s" if necessary (or "ed" for past tense);
similarly for "[-es]". 

"[e-s]" is used for verbs already ending in "e".

You can also say "[-s|ed]" or "[-es|ed]" when the subject is fixed:

	"Time pass[-es|ed]."

Some English verbs do not form their past tense by adding "ed"; for
example, the past tense of "eat" is "ate". These verbs have their own
special commands for printing, and are in the form "[eats*]" or "[eat*]"
("[eat*]" assumes the player is the subject):

	"[You] [see*] nothing special about [the % dobj]."

The full list of irregular verbs known to this extension is:

	eat*, feel*, find*, get*, give*, hear*, lead*, put*, see*, take*.

Section: Auxiliary Verbs: "You have eaten"

The verb "have" is used in two different ways in English. In the sentence
"You have an apple", "have" is a verb meaning "own, carry". In the sentence
"You have eaten the apple", the main verb is "eaten" - "have" is just
an auxiliary verb that goes with the main verb.

To indicate that "have" is an auxiliary verb, put a "+" after it:

	" [You] [have+] died "
	... "even if [you] [haven't+] been there before"
	... "even if [you've+] been there before"

Section: The Current Object

In order to print the appropriate verb endings and so on, this extension
must keep track of the current object (the player, the "%" object,
the person doing the action, etc). Usually this is the last mentioned
object in the message.

However, sometimes a library message must refer to an object which has not
yet been mentioned. It is possible to set the current object explicitly
with "=>" (see below), but usually the extension can figure out which
object was meant. For example:

	"[That's|they're] hardly portable."

In this case, "[That's|they're]" is assumed to refer to the main object;
it will print "That's" for singular or "They're" for plural.

Similarly:

	"Which [do] [you] mean, " ...

In this case, "[do]" is assumed to refer to the player, and will print
"do" or "does" as appropriate.

To explicitly set the thing being referred to, the following commands
may be embedded in the text (none of which actually print anything):

	"[=> %]"
	"[=> actor]"  -- the person doing the action (usually the player)
	"[=> noun]"  -- usually the same as "%"
	"[=> ...]"  --- any other object, eg. "[=> the janitor]" 

For example:

	"[=> noun][That|those] seem[-s] to belong to [the % dobj]."

(This is a rare case when "%" and "the noun" are two different objects).

It is also possible to force the tense to be past or present (note that
each "[=> present tense]" should have a matching "[=> default tense]").

	"[You] [=> present tense]need[-s][=> default tense] to be holding [the % dobj] before [you] can put [it|them] into something else."

If it is ever necessary to print the current object explicitly, the symbol "$" may be used.
This acts just like "%", so you can say:

	"[The $]"
	"[the $]"
	"[$]"
	"[the $ dobj]"
	"[$ dobj]"

Section: Conditions

Many messages print different things depending on special conditions, such as
whether the player or another character is doing the action, or whether
multiple objects are involved in the player's command.

The following definitions are included in this extension:

	if the gender of <object> is <gender> ...
	if the player is doing the action ...
	if the player is not doing the action ...
	if the player can see the actor ...
	if there are multiple objects ...
	if noun is living ...
	if game over ...

There are also some shorthand ways of checking the tense, person or number:

	if lm_present ...
	if lm_past ...
	if lm_p1 ...
	if lm_p2 ...
	if lm_p3 ...
	if lm_sing ...
	if lm_plu ...

Section: Numbers

Some library messages refer to a particular number. For these messages only,
a number called "the numeric amount" may be used to access the number.
For example:

	"Your score has just gone
	[if numeric amount >= 0]up by [the numeric amount]
	[otherwise]down by [0 minus the numeric amount]
	[end if] point[s]"

A special command is available to print either "is" or "are" for a number:

	"[if the numeric amount is 0]None of those are
	[otherwise]Only [numeric amount in words] of those [is|are for numeric amount]
	[end if] available."

Section: Special Characters

Certain characters such as "." and "!" are special to Inform, and can
cause unexpected effects when printed (such as causing a paragraph break).
A few commands have been defined in this extension to allow these symbols
to be printed normally:

	"." -- "[dot]"
	"!" -- "[ExMark]"
	"?" -- "[QMark]"

As a convenience, the following abbreviations are also defined:

	"[/p]" -- same as "[paragraph break]"
	"[/n]" -- same as "[line break]" (newline)
	"[/r]" -- same as "[run paragraph on]"

Section: Before And After Library Messages

Two "hooks" are provided to allow something to be done before and after
a library message is printed:

	the before library messages rule
	the after library messages rule

Note that Inform prints some kinds of text before library messages are
printed; in particular, room names and descriptions. These cases may
be handled using the standard Inform 7 rule books.

During the "before library messages" rule, the special value 
"library-message-id" is set to the id of the message which is about to
be displayed. This may be changed to another message id if desired.
A "stop the action" command will also work here (but will only prevent
a message from being printed, not the action from taking place).

For example, to see the message id of each library message before it is printed:

	This is the id printing rule:
		say "{ [library-message-id] }[line break]"
	
	When play begins:
		change the before library messages rule to the id printing rule.

Section: The Player And The PC

Certain library messages address the player directly (as opposed to the
Player Character). These messages always print a literal "you" instead
of "[you]". For example:

	" You have won "

Section: Using Commands Outside The Library

The commands like "[you]", "[the $]", etc. may be used outside of the
library messages with some care. The current object may need to be
set with "[=> ...]" several times during a paragraph. For example:

	say "[=> nasty creature][The $] glar[e-s] at [you dobj].
		[You] stumbl[e-s] backwards towards the cliff edge,
		almost losing [your] footing.
		[=> nasty creature][He] start[-s] to advance towards [you dobj]."

Depending on what the "nasty creature" is and the tense/person/number/gender
settings, the above command may produce something like the following:

	The wolves glared at me. I stumbled backwards towards the cliff edge, almost losing my footing. They started to advance towards me.

It is also possible to change what "%" refers to with "[% => ...]"; for example:

	say "[% => nasty creature][You] [can] [see*] [the % dobj] crouching among the rocks. "

Section: Debugging

The current object may be displayed whenever it changes by turning on
debugging:

	change library_message_debug to on.

The current object will be displayed in curly brackets like this:

	"{<debug text>:obj=rock}"

Section: Known Bugs And Limitations

The rules for contents listing ("providing light", "which is open", etc)
have not been replaced. It should be possible to modify these messages
via the appropriate rule books.

Contents listing for past tense has a more difficult problem; the "is/are" in things
like "On the table is a key" and "In the box are a cat and a dog" is difficult to change
to "was/were" without replacing several core Inform 6 routines (which is possible, but
slightly risky). If the game stays in past tense for the whole time, here is a way to
fix this problem manually:

Edit the file "Inform 7/Library/Natural/English.h" with a normal text editor, and
search for "IS__TX" (about line 365). There are several quoted strings containing
"is" and "are". Change these to "was" and "were". Note that this will need to be
repeated each time you update your version of Inform 7.

Bug reports and suggestions may be sent to "davidfisher@australiaonline.net.au"
(with a meaningful subject line, such as "[I7 library messages] ...") or posted
to the "rec.arts.int-fiction" newsgroup.

Section: Acknowledgements

Apart from the obvious person with the initials GN (and other letters raham elson),
thanks to the "rec.arts.int-fiction" newsgroup for suggestions and encouragement,
and to Emily Short for her inspirational Plurality extension, some of which
I have borrowed (OK, stolen) for this extension.

Thanks also to Jesse McGrew for a way to avoid having to change the standard library files.

Section: Change History

Version 1 (June 6th, 2006)

	* Initial version, plenty of bugs.

Version 2 (June 8th, 2006)

	* Added Parts and Sections + contents listing.
	* Improved documentation (added numbering to Messages section).
	* Added "[$]" (prints the current object).
	* Fixed handling of various messages (too many to remember :-)

Version 3 (June 13th, 2006)

	* Replaced message rules with a table of message ids & text (using binary search to look up message ids).
	* Added section "Using Commands Outside The Library" to documentation.
	* Added abbreviations "[/p]", "[/n]" and "[/r]".
	* Added "[you|yourself]" command for situations where player is both the subject and the object (rarely needed, since "[.. dobj]" will usually handle automatically).
	* Renamed the "case" kind to "letter case" to avoid conflicts with any objects named "case".
	* Renamed arguments to "say" rules from "x" to "x_", etc. to avoid conflicts (possibly a bug in Inform 7 that local arguments don't always take precedence over globals).
	* Renamed the "vague go" rule to "block vaguely going" for consistency with the	existing Inform library, and made it work properly.
	* Fixed rules for printing 'did' / 'didn't' (was not setting the current object).
	* Fixed the rules about newly visible exteriors.
	* Small improvement to Thee and Thou example (handle doubling of "t": put -> putteth, etc)

Version 4 (June 14th, 2006)

	* Made sure "try silently" doesn't print anything if the action fails.
	* Handle messages defined as "" (empty string) properly (sometimes printed a spurious newline).
	* If there is more than one reporting rule defined in the Standard Rules for an action, made sure the others are still followed (eg. the "don't report successful implicit takes" rule).
	* Gave all appropriate messages separate "report player ..." and a "report npc ..." messages.
	* Changed "report other person ..." messages to "report npc ..." for consistency.
	* Renamed LibMsg <check life property for giving> to LibMsg <unable to receive things> for clarity.
	* Renamed LibMsg <futile to throw things at inanimate objects> to LibMsg <throw at inanimate object>.

Version 5 (June 28th, 2006)

	* Removed need for library change "#IFNDEF LibraryMessagesProvided" in Verblib.h (thanks to Jesse McGrew).
	* Changed "lower" and "upper" to "lower-case" and "upper-case" respectively to avoid potential conflicts.
	* Added references to alternate, smaller extension "Default Messages".
	* Made sure extension works with I7 build 3R85.

Version 6 (July 7th, 2006)

	* Fixed bug causing stack overflow when pushing objects (in a compass direction).
	* Added disclaimer to "Thee and Thou" example.

Version 7 (July 17th, 2006)

	* Added "set the library message 'he' text" functionality to make changing third person singular form of "[you]" to some other word (eg. "the gunfighter") easy to do.
	* Changed definition of "To say you" and "To say you dobj" to make the above possible.
	* Added "Setting The Character's Name" section.

Version 8 (July 20th, 2006)

	* Changed "set the library message 'he' text" to "set the library message third person text" and allowed library message gender to be changed when this is used.

Version 9 (July 24th, 2006)

	* Fixed the "before/after library messages" rules; these are now rules that vary (since it is no longer possible to override a rule just by redefining it). Thanks to Jeff Nyman for noticing this problem.
	* Altered the "Out of World" example accordingly.
	* Also added a space to some messages (LibMsg <top line what on>, etc).

Version 10 (July 28th, 2006)

	* Fix to bug introduced in V9; crashed when trying to go in a disallowed direction instead of saying "You can't go that way" (thanks again to Jeff Nyman for noticing this).

Version 11 (August 15th, 2006)

	* Removed extraneous newline after <who disambiguation>, <which disambiguation> and <score command> messages (thanks again Jeff!)

Version 12 (August 22nd, 2006)

	* Changed "[his]" rule to "[-his]" to avoid bizarre conflict with another extension (Scheduled Activities by John Clemens).
	* Fixed up plural forms for "his".

Version 13 (August 29th, 2006)

	* Removed "[Story name]" from the text of "LibMsg <verbose look mode>", etc. since Inform already prints it (thanks to Arnel Legaspi for this one).

Version 14 (November 14th, 2006)

	* Made sure the extension compiles for Glulx (by disabling the I6 code that fixes the bug described in Version 6, which no longer seems to happen in I7 version 4B91 anyway).

Version 15 (January 28th, 2007)

	* Current object was not being set properly the very first time (thanks to Jeff Nyman again for pointing this out).
	* Added a note about verbs which have been removed from Inform 7 ("swim", etc).

Version 16 (March 26th, 2007)

	* Updated for I7 version 4S08 (removed comments from inside tables and modified definition of "[/n]").

Version 17 (March 27th, 2007)

	* Replaced the last remaining procedurual rule with a static ordering statement (thanks to Stephen Granade).
	* Removed the LibMsg <player description> rule ("As good-looking as ever"), and added new section "The 'Examine me' Text" to explain how to set this value.

Version 18 (June 23rd, 2007)

	* Updated to work with I7 version 4U65.
	* Added LibMsg <examine direction>.
	* Removed "Thee and Thou" example (too many issues to update).

Version 19 (August 9th, 2007)

	* Made sure "(in/on ...)" is printed correctly after the room name.

Version 20 (August 24th, 2007)

	* Fixed past tense of "You get off the {supporter} ..."
	* Added past tense contents description bug to Known Bugs and Limitations section.

Version 21 (August 25th, 2007)

	* Change "here" to "there" in past tense for things like "You can see a dog here / You could see a dog there".

Version 22 (September 1st, 2007)

	* Made "yourself" print the right thing for first and third person (thanks to J. J. Lawless and Syzygy).

Version 23 (November 21st, 2007)
	* Fixed problem with saying "[pronoun word]" (eg. "I'm not sure what 'it' refers to") (thanks to Juhana
Leinonen for finding this).
	* Added paste icons to examples (thanks, Emily).
	* Added "section:" headings to documentation.

Version 24 (January 13th, 2008)
	* In the "custom report exiting rule", temporarily set the noun to the "container exited from" (ie. the action variable for the exiting action) (thanks to Mike Tarbert for pointing out this issue).
	* Renamed "Library message debug" variable to "Library_message_debug" to avoid potential conflicts (eg. objects with the word "library" in their name).
	* Fixed bizarre infinite recursion when trying to print the name of the current object if it equals the player.

Version 25 (April 20th, 2008)
	* Changes to I7 required a major update - many changes.
	* Library message number changed to Library message grammatical number to avoid clashing with new I7 libraries.
	* Removed "^" from upper case "to say" rules (eg. "[The %]" instead of "[^The %]").
	* Added new messages (see New Messages In This Version, above).
	* Removed references to I6 actions which do not exist in I7: Order, FullScore, Places, Objects, EmptyT, VagueGo, JumpOver, Swim, Blow, Dig, Fill, Set and Pray.
	* Updated the "block pushing in directions" message to match the new standard message.

Version 26 (August 29th, 2008)
	* Added section 5.3 (Locale description), containing code by Emily Short to make the standard "you can see" message call this extension.

Version 27 (October 5th, 2008)
	* Tense was being treated as "past" by default in some situations unless preceeded by "[you]"; now fixed (thanks to Jeff Nyman for pointing this out). Note that "[=> default tense]" is now required after "[=> present tense]" to revert to the current tense.
