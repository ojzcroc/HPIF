Room & Dimension ends here.


---- DOCUMENTATION ---- 


This extension provides the possibility to put an extra 2D layer upon rooms. This can be handy, if visual feedback is required while moving the player or other things inside a room manually.

It requires both the Glulx Text Effects and Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short to run properly. The extension uses one Glulx custom style (special-style-2) and defines say "[default letters]" as say "[roman type]".

First, we will need to create a Table to save objects and to print the map of the room we want to visualize. For this we can use one of the templates that are provided within the extension (look the last example below), depending on how broad we want the room to be (in this version it is limited to 28 sectors maximum). The width is both visible in the name of the table, in case of the templates, and the actual Width Entry. 

The Width Entry is crucial for the program to determine the columns it has access to and must always fit the actual map width otherwise it will create a bug (this is also true for the Height Entry in the current version). 

There are two types of templates that can be identified by the bracketed number next to the table name: extended (the one with the 0. and 1. numeration) and normal (with no punctuation). Since the number of columns seems to be limited in Inform 7, the program is tricked to jump from one table to another. Therefore, the table with the (0.x) number represents the left side of the map and the one with the (1.x) the extended right side. 

It is important for both tables to have a correct Height and Width Entry.


We must then signalise that this room is actually printable. For this we use the location name and connect it with one or more table names. This happens in a continuation of the Table 997 - 'Sectors' which looks like this:

	Table 997 - Sectors (continued) 
	Sector Room	            Table	              Table 2
	My Room 	            Table 100
	My Room 2	            Table 101	Table 102


'My Room 2' uses an extended table with the table in the Table Entry representing the left side of the map and the one in the Table 2 Entry the right side.


After we decided on Height and Width and established a connection between rooms and tables we can start to fill the map with objects. Every thing has two parameters to save its current coordinates: X-Axis -> a number representing the current row position and Y-Axis -> a text representing the current column position. We don't have to declare those manually however. It is sufficient if we place the objects on the map and make sure our source code includes:

	When play begins:
	Spread coordinates.


The program will then run through all maps and give coordinates to every object it can find automatically. It should be noted however that an object on a map doesn't have to be in the room that it is corresponding to (and won't be moved there with any of the commands this extension provides except for "switch maps" which is not supposed to be used by ourselves). This might cause confusion within the program so we always have to make sure that an object on a map of a room is actually in said room.

Since we want to see those objects on the map, we will have to provide them with Avatars (we can hardly want to use its printed name or its description for that matter).
To do this we have to continue yet another table:

	Table 991 - Avatars (continued)
	Entity	Avatar
	Dummy	"D"

The program differs between the Avatar of a person and of anything else. A person's Avatar will always be printed in extra bold letters while the ones of others will not.

Whenever the truth state 'Show Map' is true, the program will print the map of the location in which the player is moving (he himself is always represented by an arrow).
 
Next to the objects that we create for our program, there are three special kinds of things that are provided with the extension. They all have in common that they've actually no coherent position on the map, since they are either not suppose to represent one entity or their presence is only temporary (in case of Entrance Points). 


1. None -> Is a thing and refers to empty space. An object on the map can move on a None field without anything happening.

2. Wall -> Is a kind. Every object, that is a Wall, will not allow anything to take its place. If an object tries anyways, a short message will appear (can be avoided by changing the truth state of 'uncommented' to true) and the action will be stopped. 

3. Entrance Points -> Again a kind. They enable the player to switch between rooms, while 'Show Map' is true. It should be noted that the coordinates of an object will currently not change if it should go into another room while 'Show Map' is false.

There are also two new kinds of persons: hostile person and friendly person. A friendly person will switch places with the player if the player walks into him while hostile ones serve as another kind of wall in a sense. If the player walks into an object which the extension doesn't know for certain (that would be anything that wasn't mentioned above) it will create an ugly bug.

The extension differs between dark rooms and normal rooms when printing the map. A normal will always show the whole map while a dark room without a light source will only show the actual surroundings of the player.   

It should be mentioned that the status line will undergo slight changes once 'Show Map' is true. It will then show the current position on the map where the player is standing. To remove this effect either ignore the Map headline rule or change Table 801 - Map Headline in section 2.6. In case the player is in a dark room a question mark is used instead of coordinates.  

The following examples should serve as a quick overview about what is possible with the extension as it will explain several important commands in a more practical way.


Example: * One Room creation - Creating a small test room and a command that will either make the corresponding map appear or disappear.

	*: Include Room & Dimension by Sebastian Rahn.


Let us begin by creating a room and giving it some shape.
	
	*:Test room is a room.
	
	Table 100 - Test Room
	Number	                LE	  A1	  B2	  C3	  RE	  Height	         Width
	1            	None	None	None	None	None	   5	          5
	2            	None	None	None	None	None	   	          
	3            	None	None	Yourself	None	None	   	          
	4            	None	None	None	None	None	   	          
	5            	None	None	None	None	None	   	          


That's pretty bland but suitable for this demonstration. Note that if you want to place a player character other than 'Yourself' on the map you'll either have to use the name of said character instead or, if you really want to use 'Player', then there is another option that will be demonstrated in the next example.

Now we create a link between the room and the corresponding map.
 	
	*:Table 997 - Sectors (continued)
	Sector Room	Table
	Test Room	Table 100
	

If we don't want to show the map all the time, we can create a command that will switch the Truth State 'Showing map' either to true or false which will either show the map or prevent it from being printed.
	
	*:Work Done is a truth state that varies.
	
	Showing map is an action applying to nothing.
	Understand "Show map" or "Map" as Showing map.
	
	Carry out Showing map:
	Change Work Done to false;
	If Show Map is false
		begin; 
		Change Show Map to true;
		Change Work Done to true;
		say "You unfold your map to look where you are.";
	end if;
	If Work Done is false
		begin;
		Change Show Map to false;
		say "You put the map back into your bag.";
	end if.
	 

We have to be careful of the EP room, where all Entrance Points are stored, as it will most likely be declared the starting room since it is probably created first. To prevent this we either make sure that the player is moved to the place we want him at the start of the game (like in this example) or create the starting location before including the extension. Also, since we're lazy, we don't give the player any coordinates on his way but let the program figure it out with the "Spread Coordinates" command.
	
	*:When play begins: 
	Move player to Test room;
	Spread Coordinates.


Example: *** The Lair of Don Capone - A small game scenario to test room connections, if a person stands next to another and if the program will recognize obstacles like walls and hostile persons.

We have to make some slight changes compared to the first example since this time, we want to print the map every turn from start to finish. Therefore, we place the starting room before the extensions and let its description print the map for the very first time.

	*:The Streets is a room. "It is a lively day on Chepston Streets as usual. The Don Capone, restaurant of the rich and morally challenged, stands before you. The place where you want to go. [If Streets is unvisited][paragraph break][map][end if]".	

	Include Room & Dimension by Sebastian Rahn.


Let's start again by creating our first room. This time thought we will need a so called Entrance Point. Since we place the entrance of the restaurant to the South at it is seen on the map below, this will be a South Entrance Point. We may not forget to put all Entrance Points in the EP Room. 
	
	*:Table 100 - The Streets
	Number	                LE	  A1	  B2	  C3	  RE	  Height	         Width
	1            	-Wall	-Wall	-Wall	-Wall	-Wall	   7	          5
	2            	Jenny	None	None	None	None	   	          
	3            	None	None	None	None	None	   
	4            	None	None	None	None	None
	5            	None	None	None	None	None	          
	6            	None	Bully2	Bully1	Bully3	None	   	          
	7            	-Wall	-Wall	Southdoor	-Wall	-Wall	   

	Table 997 - Sectors (continued)
	Sector Room	Table 
	Streets	Table 100 

	Southdoor is a South Entrance Point in EP.
	Bully1 is a hostile person in Streets. The printed name of Bully1 is "Bulky Bully". The description of Bully1 is "Gee, that's a big fellow!".	
            Understand "Bulky Bully" as Bully1.
	Bully2 is a hostile person in Streets. The printed name of Bully2 is "Slimy Bully". The description of Bully2 is "You can tell by the looks of him that you won't become friends.".	
	Understand "Slimy Bully" as Bully2.
	Bully3 is a hostile person in Streets. The printed name of Bully3 is "Bland Bully". The description of Bully3 is "Now you know what pure average looks like.".	
	Understand "Bland Bully" as Bully3.
	Jenny is a friendly person in Streets. The description of Jenny is "Flatear Jenny is an old acquaintance of yours and always helpful when it comes to this kind of situations. Maybe you should talk to her.".


Since we got other people in the room except the player, we must prepare Avatars so that the map will print out properly .
 
	
	*:Table 991 - Avatars (continued)
	Entity	Avatar
	Bully1	"B"
	Bully2	"s"
	Bully3	"b"
	Jenny	"J"

	Talking to is an action applying  to one visible thing.
	Understand "Talk to [person]" or "Talk [person]" as Talking to .

 	Carry out Talking to someone (called actor):
	If actor is not Jenny, say "That wouldn[apostrophe]t achieve anything".


We want the player to only be able to greet Jenny while she is in a neighbouring field. Therefore: 

	*:Check Talking to Jenny:
	If Jenny is not connected with player
		begin;
		say "Flatear Jenny won[apostrophe]t hear you as long as you don't come closer.";
		stop the action;
	end if.

There is also the possibility to ask "If [thing] is connected with [thing]" although this is not neccessary here.
Anyways, after the player talks to Jenny she and the bullies will be completely removed from the map, meaning that they will also be removed from the game since we no longer need them. If we want them to remain in game we can use the "remove [person] from map" command instead. This would not remove them from the room however.
 	
	*:Carry out Talking to Jenny:
	say "You have a little conversation in which both of you repeatedly turn your heads over to the musclemen that block the entrance of the restaurant. After you pass a few bills, Jenny walks over to them. Two 	minutes later your path is clear. Jenny has proven reliable as always.".  
	completely remove Jenny from map;
	completely remove Bully1 from map;
	completely remove Bully2 from map;
	completely remove Bully3 from map.


Onwards into the restaurant.

	*:The Restaurant is a room. The Restaurant is south of Streets. The description of restaurant is "This place isn[apostrophe]t as grand as you thought it would be. But this comes with the advantage that the food counter isn[apostrophe]t too far away neither.".

	Table 101 - The Restaurant
	Number	  LE	  A1	  RE	  Height	         Width
	1	/Corner	Northdoor	\Corner	    6	           3
	2	|Wall	None	|Wall
	3	|Wall	None	|Wall
	4	|Wall	-Wall	|Wall
	5	|Wall	Waiter	|Wall
	6	\Corner	-Wall	/Corner
	
	Table 997 - Sectors (continued)
	Sector Room	Table 
	Restaurant	Table 101 

	Northdoor is a North Entrance Point in EP.
	Waiter is a person in restaurant. The description of Waiter is "This man looks quiet bored.".

	Table 991 - Avatars (continued)
	Entity	Avatar
	Waiter	"W"

We set up a winning condition for the game: get food!

	*:Every turn when player is in restaurant: 
	If X-Axis of player is 3
		begin;
		say "[apostrophe]Hello Sir, may I take your order?[apostrophe] You are delighted. This evening is going to be delicious!";
		end the game in victory;
	end if.


We now have two Entrance Points: Southdoor in Streets and Northdoor in the Restaurant. If we want to connect them, we'll have to expand this Table:	

	*:Table 994 - Junctures (continued)
	Entrance	            Exit Point	                Exit Room	           Position_1  	Position_2	Position_3	Height_1	Height_2	Height_3	Entrance_Height
	Southdoor	            Northdoor	                Restaurant	               ""	               "A"	                ""	               0	                0	                0 	                2
	Northdoor	            Southdoor	                Streets	              "A"	               "B"	                "C"	               0	                0	                0 	                6

Granted that this looks rather complicated. 
Basically, we declare an Entrance Point that we enter (Entrance Entry) and the one we leave (Entrance Point). Those two are important for the program to recognize which maps should be used (the ones where each Entrance Point is located, at least on the map). The Exit Room Entry is simply the room where the moving actor is taken to. The three Position_x Entries are exclusively for South and North Entrance Points. With them we can determine in which column the actor will appear. The program will try first to move the actor to Position 2 and then work its way back to 3. If all of them are either occupied or not available (marked with "" as demonstrated in the first row of the above example) the actor will not move to the Exit Room but remains where he is. The Height_x Entries do pretty much the same for the West and East Entrance Points as Position_x for North and South but, as we can see, use numbers instead of Letters (0 equals "" in this case). The Entrance_Height Entry is only important for South and North Entrance Points as it determines the row in which the actor is placed. 

The last function that is introduced in this example is the "change sector [Y-Axis] and [X-Axis] in [room] to [thing]" to place the player on the map. Objects that are placed with this command won't be moved from room to room and the old Entry on the map will also not be removed meaning that, before we use this command to move an object, we first have to delete it from the map, move it to its destination and then use the command. We can use either the corresponding letter for the Y-Axis (like "A" for the A1 Entry. The left and right ends of the map are reffered to as "LE" and "RE") or a number while the X-Axis is always a number. If there is an object in the picked sector it will only be overwritten on the map and not removed from the room. There is also another command that works in a similar fashion called "pick sector [Y-Axis] and [X-Axis] in [room]", that will not change the chosen sector but takes its object and save it under the parameter 'Tmp_Picked'.   

	*:When play begins:
	change sector "B" and 5 in Streets to player;
	Spread Coordinates;
	Change Show Map to true.


Example: **** The Curse of Quapeck - A longer example where several possibilities of how to use the given tools are experimented with. 


This example will use some commands from the AI extension namely "[thing] follows [thing]" and "calculate minimum distance between [thing] and [thing]". The first command allows an objects to move to another object on the map. Both objects have to be in the same room for the command to work. The second will save the direct (preferably in a straight line) distance between two objects under the parameter 'Stepscounter'.

	
	*:The Tomb is a room. "You can hardly see anything since the torches you lit earlier (at least you believe it was you) are barely enough to light the centre of the Tomb. A primitive altar out of stone stands there surrounded by four pillars. You remember that there is an Entry to the south although it is hidden in the dark.".

Let us begin by placing the player on the map and spread the coordinates. While we are at it: a short introducing couldn't hurt. The map will always be shown this time.
	
	*:When play begins:
	Change Sector "I" and 10 in Tomb to player;
	spread coordinates;
	Change Show Map to true;
	say "[apostrophe]Outch! That hurts![apostrophe] is the first thing that comes to your mind as you reach for your chest followed by [apostrophe]What the hell happened?[apostrophe]. [line break]You lie face down on muddy floor, you[apostrophe]ve got trouble breathing since every bit of air you inhale is accompanied by even more pain and to top it off your short-term memory seems to take a vacation. Then it dawns you. [apostrophe]Oh my god! I must[apostrophe]ve had an heart attack! Bob even warned me that it was a bad idea climbing down here without having my medicine handy.[apostrophe] Other memories start to tinkle in slowly as you get up. Where are you? A cave? No, you are certain it is a Tomb. The Shapes in your sight become clearer forming space, objects, people. (Why is it so quiet?)

The goal of the first room is to try to rescue Bob, who is located at the lower right corner, by moving to a field next to him. If the player is there, Bob will panic and try to flee the room. After he has left, Adam will start to chase the player. The player, on the other hand, will die if Adam reaches a field next to him. If the player manages to escape, Adam will be placed directly in front of the Entrance Point, preventing the player to re-enter the tomb. We'll need some truth states for this.

	*:Bob running is a truth state that varies.
	Adam chasing is a truth state that varies.

	Pillars is a thing in Tomb. "These pillars have been carved by real craftsmen no doubt although craze craftsmen perhaps. You can see skulls of strange creatures, bizarre hybrids of men and beasts, which are apparently 	clashed together in a never ending struggle. They always spin around and around the pillar only to start all over again.".

	Understand "Pillar" as Pillars.  
	Instead of doing anything other than examining pillars: say "You rather don[apostrophe]t touch them. They could bite.".

	Altar is a thing in Tomb. "The Altar itself is an ungodly ugly thing that seems old enough to originate from the early Bronze Age. Maybe even from the Stone Age for all you care. You feel something strongly repulsive 	about it as if all your instincts would deliberately try to keep you away. With all the fresh blood spilled on and around the altar you are not certain if you even *want* to get closer.".   
	The description of Altar is "This ungodly ugly thing seems old enough to originate from the early Bronze Age. Maybe even from the Stone Age for all you care.

	Instead of doing anything other than examining altar: say "You would have to get closer first.".

	Adam is a Hostile person in Tomb. "[If Adam chasing is false]Professor Adam stands next to the altar of Quapeck (from where is that name?). The evil spirits of this place have turned this once affable, well educated 	man into a monstrous corruption of his former self. He stares at you with a satisfied grin. His teeth covered in red. Your chest starts to hurt even more by the sheer look of it. It is clear that you must get away from 	that person as fast as possible.[otherwise]It is Professor Adam. Still insane and still with a knife.[end if]".

	Bob is a Friendly person in Tomb. "[If Bob running is false]Bob, your once loyal assistant, cowers in a far away corner of the Tomb muttering to himself in madness.

	Instead of doing anything other than examining or talking to Bob: say "That wouldn't help him.".
	
	Talking to is an action applying to one thing.
	Understand "Talk to [person]" or "Talk [person]" or "call [person]" or "call out for [person]" as talking to.

	Carry out talking to Bob when Bob running is false:
	say "You try to call out for him to get his attention but he is not reacting. Perhaps you[apostrophe]ll have to get closer?".

	Carry out talking to Bob when Bob running is true:
	say "That wouldn[apostrophe]t help. His hysteric screaming would easily drown everything you could muster at the moment.".
	  
	Check examining nothing:
	say "There is no time for this nonsense!";
	stop the action.

	Instead of doing something with nothing:
	say "There is no time for this nonsense!".

	Check waiting:

	stop the action.

	Check examining yourself:
	say "You can leave the medical examination for later!";
	stop the action.
		

Let's not forget to give Adam and Bob some Avatars.

Now to the part when the player tries to go somewhere where he's not supposed to (except he 'rescued' Bob). To determine if the player wants to use the southern Entry we use a technique that will also come in handy for the next room. Basically, we mime the check run of the original 'Moving player' rule (from "Change Compass to player;" to "check sector;"), that changes the parameter 'Freespace' to the object that is present in the sector the player wants to go. Since it is a more specific rule than the 'moving player' rule the new rule will always be called first.   

	*:Check going a direction (called destination) in Tomb (this is the Tomb Script rule):
	If Closer Look is true
		begin;
		say "You try to get closer to the altar but as you step between the pillars sudden, intense agony fills your body. Adam laughs hysterically as you stumble back writhing in pain.";
		stop the action;
	end if;
	Change Compass to player;
	Change Tmp_Direction to destination;
	turn around;
	check sector;
	If Freespace is Tomb_South
		begin;
		If Bob is in Tomb
			begin;
			say "You look back to see Bob still sitting in his corner. Despite all your fear, you can[Apostrophe]t just leave him behind with this madman.";
			stop the action;
		end if;
		If Adam chasing is true
			begin;
			remove adam from map;
			Change sector "J" and 11 in Tomb to Adam;
			Change Adam chasing to false;
		end if;
	end if.
	
	
This segment handles the situation where either Bob is fleeing or Adam is chasing the player. The 'Tomb_South' must be moved to the tomb to make the "Bob follows Tomb_South;" line taking any effect. We also try out the "calculate minimum distance" command so we can leave a comment if Adam comes closer. (Disclaimer: Since some bizarre timing thing, that I couldn't figure out yet, you'll have to place the calculating distance command before the following command)  
	
	*:Every turn (this is the Bob discovered rule):
	If Bob running is true
		begin;
		move Tomb_South to Tomb;
		If Bob is connected with Tomb_South
			begin;
			Completely remove Bob from map;
			Change Bob running to false;
			say "Shortly after you[Apostrophe]ve lost Bob out of sight you can hear an unpleasant crunching noise followed by eerie silence. [Apostrophe]Poor Bob,[Apostrophe] Adam looks amused [Apostrophe]never was the cautious type. But we should attend to our own little agenda now. Isn[Apostrophe]t that right, Mr. Anderson?[Apostrophe] He comes out from behind the altar. Judging by the large knife he is holding you think it is time to depart.";
			Change Adam chasing to true;
		otherwise;
			Bob follows Tomb_South;
		end if;
		move Tomb_South to EP;
	end if;
	If Bob is in Tomb
		begin;
		If player is connected with Bob
			begin;
			say "You place your hand on Bob[Apostrophe]s shoulder who finally turns around to face you. The expression of utter despair that marks his face is truly shocking. As your eyes meet he seems to be trapped in a moment of disbelief. Then he suddenly starts to scream at the top of his lungs and pushes you away with all his strength. You stumble back in surprise and brutally collide with the pillar behind you. While you try to get back on your feet you can see his silhouette running to the southern exit, still screaming.";
			remove Bob from map;
			Change sector "L" and 11 in Tomb to Bob;
			remove player from map;
			Change sector "P" and 10 in Tomb to player;
			Change Looking Direction of player to Face South;
			Change Bob running to true;
		end if;
	end if.

	The Bob discovered rule is listed before the Print map rule in the every turn rules.
	
	Every turn (this is the Adam chasing player rule):
	If Adam is connected with player
		begin;
		say "The pain finally gets the better of you and forces you to your knees. You prepare for cold steel to cut your throat as Adam reaches you. Suddenly, Adams lowers his knife and touches your chest with the other hand muttering in a tongue you don[Apostrophe]t understand. Cognizance strikes you as you start to lose consciousness, never to awake again.";
		end the game in death;
	end if;
	If Adam chasing is true
		begin;
		calculate minimum distance between player and Adam;
		Adam follows player;
		If stepscounter is 3, say "You can feel your heart pounding faster while the distance between you and Adam diminishes.";

This rule is a precaution in case the player wants to go to a sector that no longer exists.
