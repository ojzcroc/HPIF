"Player Name generation" by Orion Zymaris

The factory is a room.
player object is a thing in factory.
player object name is an indexed text that varies.
after reading a command:
	now player object name is the player's command;
	now the printed name of player object is player object name;
	say player object name.
understand "[text]" as player object.
before doing anything:
	if the printed name of player object is the text of the player's command:
		say "HI".
