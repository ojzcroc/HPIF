Harry Potter Ch2 game puzzle ideas:
For the home, just have easter eggs, and maybe a small puzzle.
For the zoo, make a babel-fish catching trail.
trail: you have to go between different rooms of the zoo to figure out how to retrieve something Dudley lost.
Dudley will lose his brand new expensive camera, and Uncle Vernon will tell you to go and get it.

You start by going to find where the camera is. There will be one room (maybe randomized) with a shelf, too high to reach, that will have the
camera on it (make reference to the impossibility of Dudley having got it up there), and you have to figure out a way to get it down. 
There will be a stick in one of the other rooms.
