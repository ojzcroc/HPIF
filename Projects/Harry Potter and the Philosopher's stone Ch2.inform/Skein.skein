Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone
Based on by &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s stone&quot; by J.K. Rowling. This game is not approved by J. K. Rowling. It exists because I am a fan of Harry Potter and text adventures, and is not a commercial venture. by Orion Zymaris
Release 1 / Serial number 131215 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Cupboard under the stairs (in Bed)
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions. Not as interesting as the dream you were having - There had been a flying motorbike in it. You have a funny feeling that you&apos;ve had the same dream before...

You can see Cupboard door (south), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too.
    Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice which made the first noise of the day.</result>

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew in the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursley&apos;s front door; it crept into their living-room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.</result>

Only the photographs on the mantlepiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-coloured bobble hats - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large, blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a roundabout at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.</result>

The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too.
    Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice which made the first noise of the day.</result>

Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions. Not as interesting as the dream you were having - There had been a flying motorbike in it. You have a funny feeling that you&apos;ve had the same dream before...

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions. Not as interesting as the dream you were having - There had been a flying motorbike in it. You have a funny feeling that you&apos;ve had the same dream before...

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions. Not as interesting as the dream you were having - There had been a flying motorbike in it. You have a funny feeling that you&apos;ve had the same dream before...

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

&quot;Up!&quot; Screeches Petunia.

local zoo carpark (in car)
to the north is the zoo&apos;s entrance.

You can see a zoo entrance (in which is entrance lady) here.

In car you can see Uncle Vernon, Piers Polkiss, Dudley and Aunt Petunia.

&gt;[16] get out
Dudley and Piers immediately push past you to get to the entrance, where they&apos;re selling ice-creams. Uncle Vernon chuckles and hops out, buying them both a large, chocolate ice-cream.

&gt;[17] n
as you walk past, the lady at the entrance smiles and asks you if you would like something as well. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia look at each other, before getting you a cheap lemon ice lolly. They grab you and drag you away before the lady can bestow any more kindness on you.

&quot;Well, have a look around everyone!&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;We&apos;ve got a bit of time untill we have to go eat lunch. We should meet in the nocturnal animal ex... exh... er, room, when lunchtime comes around.&quot; 
Gorilla Enclosure
You can see a few people goggling through the bars at the rather bored looking gorillas. To the north is the bird room - to the south, the zoo entrance. to the east, the reptile house. and west, the monkeys exhibit.

You can see Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, Piers Polkiss and a Gorilla&apos;s cage (closed) (in which are three Gorillas) here.

nocturnal room
to the south is the reptile house. You can see a few creatures, sleeping.

You can see walkway stairs (up) here.

After a while of looking around the exhibits, Dudley, who has a remarkably short attention span, starts complaining. &quot;I want to eat&quot;, he says. &quot;Ok&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;Let&apos;s go get some food. And Harry, Dudley lost his camera in one of the exhibits. If you want lunch anytime soon, go and get it for him.&quot; Dudley, Piers, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia leave without paying any attention to you. You&apos;ve got to find Dudley&apos;s camera, and then your way to the zoo&apos;s cafe.

&gt;[21] gonear camera
marsupial place
to the west is the bird room. There are small, furry little creatures in cages all around the room.

You can see a marsupial cage (closed and empty), a shelf (on which is Dudley&apos;s camera) and map here.

You use the stick to gently nudge the camera off the shelf. It falls into an open garbage chute you didn&apos;t notice beforehand.

&quot;Right! let&apos;s look at some more things, shall we? How about the reptile house?&quot; says Uncle Vernon. The others leave, without looking at you.

reptile house
to the west is the gorilla enclosure. to the north, the nocturnal room. You can see a few bored looking snakes and lizards behind the glass.

You can see Piers Polkiss, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and Dudley here.

&gt;[31] look snake
The sign next to one of the snakes says &quot;Boa Constrictor, bred in Peru&quot;.

You wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it had died of boredom - with no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up - at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

The snake suddenly opened it&apos;s beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with yours.

It winked.

The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley,  then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: &quot;I get that all the time&quot;&quot;I know&quot;, you murmur through the glass, although you don&apos;t know if the snake can hear you. &quot;It must be really annoying.&quot;

The snake nods vigorously.
&quot;Where do you come from, anyway?&quot; You ask.
The snake jabs its tail at a little sign next to the glass. You peer at it.  Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
&quot;Was it nice there?&quot;

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and you read on. 
This specimen was bred in the zoo.
&quot;Oh, I see - so you&apos;ve never been to Brazil?&quot;
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind you made both you and the snake jump. &quot;DUDLEY! MR DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON&apos;T BELIEVE WHAT IT&apos;S DOING!&quot;

&quot;Out of the way, you&quot;, snarls Dudley, punching you in the ribs. You fall. When you look back at the snake&apos;s enclosure, you see Piers and Dudley jumping back with howls of horror. The glass has vanished, and the snake is slithering awat across the floor. 
&quot;Brazil, here I come ... Thankssss, amigo.&quot;

 You see everyone standing around, looking shocked. &quot;Well, we should go&quot;, says a rather uncomfortable looking Uncle Vernon. He steers you out to the carpark, and the rest of the group follows suit.
local zoo carpark (in car)
to the north is the zoo&apos;s entrance.

You can see a zoo entrance (in which is entrance lady) here.

As everyone gets into the car, Dudley and Piers start talking loudly about the snake. Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. &quot;Harry was talking to it, weren&apos;t you, Harry?&quot; says Piers. Uncle Vernon turns the colour of beetroot. The journey home seems to take an age.

&quot;Bye Dudley&quot;, says Piers. The front door slams as he leaves. Uncle Vernon rounds on you, and says &quot;Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,&quot; before collapsing into a chair. Aunt Petunia runs to fetch him some brandy.

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

&gt;[35] sleep
Exhausted by the day, you collapse into bed. You wait until night, so you can go and get food from the kitchen without the Dursleys catching you. In the meantime, you sit and think.

You have lived with the Dursleys for almost  ten years, ten miserable years, as long as you can remember, ever since you were a baby and your parents died in a car crash. 
You can&apos;t remember being there when your parents died. Sometimes, you can recall a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on your forehead. This, you suppose, was the crash, though you can&apos;t imagine where the green light might&apos;ve come from.

 You can&apos;t remember your parents, and the Dursleys never talked about them. He wasn&apos;t allowed to ask questions, and there were no photos of them in the house.

When you were younger, you had dreamed and dreamed of an unknown relation coming to tak you away, but this never happened; The Dursleys were your only family.

Yet, sometimes, it seemed as though strangers in the street seemed to know you. Very strange strangers they were, too.

A tiny man in a violet top had bowed to you once while out shopping, and a wild-looking old woman dressed in green had waved merrily to him once. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.

The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish, the second you tried to take a closer look.

At school, you have no one. Everybody knew that Dudley&apos;s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley&apos;s gang. 

Sometime during your musings, you fall asleep.

You can&apos;t open the door. Uncle Vernon must&apos;ve locked it. You play a few games of chess against yourself and climb back into bed. Around  noon, Aunt Petunia appears to give you some food. Every day, after getting home from school, this schedule continues. You finally get let out at the end of the Summer holidays. 

Hall
Dudley is here, with his friends Piers, Malcolm, Gordon, and half of Dennis; the other half of Dennis is out the front door, since they&apos;re too large to all fit into the one room. Though all of Dudley&apos;s friends are big and stupid, Dudley, being the biggest and stupidest of the lot, is the leader. They seem to be laughing at a story Dudley just told them about knocking Mrs Figg over while riding his bike for the first time. You&apos;d like to go outside, but they&apos;re blocking the way.

You come into the kitchen in the morning to have your nostrils assaulted by a horrible smell. The smell seems to be coming from a container in the sink, full of grey water and rags. &quot;What is this?&quot;, you ask your Aunt. &quot;Your new school uniform&quot;, she says. &quot;I&apos;m dyeing some of Dudley&apos;s old things gray for you. It&apos;ll look just like everyone else&apos;s when i&apos;ve finished.&quot; Uncle Vernon and Dudley enter the room, their noses wrinkled from the smell of your uniform.

Uncle Vernon tells Dudley to get it. Dudley tells you to get it. You tell Dudley to get it. Dudley tries to hit you with his Smeltings stick. You get the letters.

Your Aunt takes the toast and throws it out. &quot;How long has that been there?&quot; She asks. No-one answers her. She seems miffed that she isn&apos;t getting any attention.

You pick up mail from the ground.

As you examine the mail, you see a postcard from Aunt Marge, who was on holiday, something that looked like a bill and - a letter for Harry. No one ever sends you letters, but here it was, a letter, adressed so plainly there could be no mistake:

Mr H. Potter
The Cupboard under the Stairs
4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey

The thick, yellowish envelope has a purple wax seal on the back, bearing a coat of arms. &quot;Hurry up, boy!&quot; shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. &quot;What are you doing, checking for letter-bombs?&quot; You hear him chuckling merrily.

&gt;[52] w
&quot;Finally&quot;, says Uncle Vernon. You give him the other letters, and keep your own.

You can see kitchen door (east), Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon (hiding behind a newspaper), Dudley, a chair, kitchen table, a cooker (on which is a the frying pan (empty)), fridge (closed) and sink here.

&gt;[53] read mail
&quot;Marge&apos;s ill&quot;, Uncle Vernon informed Aunt Petunia. &quot;Ate a funny whelk...&quot;
&quot;Dad!&quot; said Dudley suddenly. &quot;Dad, Harry&apos;s got something!&quot;
Right before you unfold the heavy parchment letter, it is jerked sharply out of your hand by your Uncle.

&quot;That&apos;s mine!&quot;, you say, trying to snatch it back.
&quot;Who&apos;d be writing to you?&quot; sneered Uncle Vernon, glancing at the letter. His face turned green. &quot;P-P-Petunia!&quot; he gasped.

Dudley tried to grab the letter, but your Uncle held it out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. 
&quot;Vernon! Oh my goodness - Vernon!&quot;
&quot;I want to read it&quot; you say, at the same time as Dudley. &quot;Get out, both of you,&quot; croaks Uncle Vernon, &quot;OUT!&quot;, before he grabs both you and Dudley by the neck and throws you out of the room.

&gt;[54] listen
&quot;Vernon,&quot; Aunt Petunia says, &quot;look at the adress - how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don&apos;t think they&apos;re watching the house?&quot;

&quot;Watching - spying - might be following us,&quot; mutters Uncle Vernon. 
&quot;What should we do? Write back?&quot; says your Aunt.
&quot;No, No, We&apos;ll ignore it. if they don&apos;t get an answer ... yes, that&apos;s best ... we won&apos;t do anything ...&quot;

&quot;But - &quot;
&quot;I&apos;m not having one in the house! Didn&apos;t we swear that we&apos;d stamp him out of this dangerous nonsense?&quot;

You can hear Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia walking around the room, muttering. Your cupboard door stands open.

&gt;[55] n
You spend the rest of the day thinking up ways of getting your letter back. After getting home from work, Uncle Vernon did something he&apos;d never done before: he visited you in your cupboard. &quot;Where&apos;s my letter?&quot; you ask. &quot;Who wrote to me?&quot;
&quot;No one. it was adressed to you by mistake,&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;I have burned it.&quot; &quot;It was not a mistake&quot;, you say. &quot;It had my cupboard on it.&quot;
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; yells Uncle Vernon. &quot;Er - yes, Harry - about this cupboard, We think you&apos;re getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley&apos;s second room. You can grab all your things and move up now.&quot;

You walk into the room and drop all of your things on the ground. Yesterday, you would&apos;ve given anything to be up here. Today, you would rather be in the cupboard, without it. From downstairs, you hear the sound of Dudley complaining about you taking his room, mingled with the sound of Uncle Vernon yelling. It appears that more letters were forced through the letter-box, through the crack between the door and the wall, and the window in the downstairs toilet. Over the next few days, more letters find their way into the house. 

One fine Sunday morning, after waking, Aunt Petunia calls you for breakfast.

Uncle Vernon, who promised he&apos;d brought rations, turned out to be in possession of four packets of crisps, and four bananas.

BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. &quot;Where&apos;s the cannon?&quot; he said stupidly. 
There was a crash as Uncle Vernon skidded into the room, holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what was in the package that he had brought with him.
&quot;Who&apos;s there?&quot; he shouted. &quot;I warn you - I&apos;m armed!;
There was a pause. Then -
SMASH!
The door was knocked off of its hinges and landed on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. The giant squeezed his way into the hut. He picked up the door and fitted it back into it&apos;s frame. He turned around to look at them. 
&quot;Couldn&apos;t make us a cup o&quot; tea, could yeh? It&apos;s not been an easy journey...&quot;
 The stranger strolled over to the sofa and told Dudley to move. Dudley instead ran squeaking over to his parents.

&quot;Up!&quot; Screeches Petunia.

&quot;Get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don&apos;t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy&apos;s birthday.&quot; 
You see the kitchen door slam as Petunia walks through and closes it. The sound of the frying pan being put on the cooker emenates from the kitchen. You&apos;d better cook the breakfast.

Aunt Petunia enters the kitchen looking angry and worried. &quot;Bad news, Vernon. Mrs Figg&apos;s broken her leg. She can&apos;t take him&quot; she says, jerking her head towards you. Dudley looks horrified. &quot;He&apos;s not coming on my birthday!&quot;

&quot;Maybe you could just leave me here&quot; you suggest. 

&quot;And come back and find the house in ruins?&quot; says Aunt Petunia.

&quot;I won&apos;t blow up the house,&quot; you say.

&quot;I suppose we could take him to the zoo, and leave him in the car,&quot; says Aunt Petunia.
&quot;The car&apos;s new, he&apos;s not sitting in it alone...&quot;
Dudley begins to cry loudly. He&apos;s not really crying, it&apos;s been years since he&apos;s done that, But he knows that Aunt Petunia will give him anything he wants if he does.

That&apos;s the doorbell. Must be Piers Polkiss, Dudley&apos;s friend. Dudley&apos;s stopped pretending to cry.
&quot;Alright, let&apos;s go,&quot; says Petunia. Everyone leaves the kitchen and gets into the Dursley&apos;s car.

as you walk past, the lady at the entrance smiles and asks you if you would like something as well. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia look at each other, before getting you a cheap lemon ice lolly. They grab you and drag you away before the lady can bestow any more kindness on you.

And Harry, Dudley lost his camera in one of the exhibits. If you want lunch anytime soon, go and get it for him.&quot; Dudley, Piers, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia leave without paying any attention to you.

&gt;[31] look snake
The sign next to one of the snakes says &quot;Boa Constrictor, bred in Peru&quot;.

You wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it had died of boredom - with no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up - at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

The snake suddenly opened it&apos;s beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with yours.

It winked.

The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley,  then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: &quot;I get that all the time&quot;&quot;I know&quot;, you murmur through the glass, although you don&apos;t know if the snake can hear you. &quot;It must be really annoying.&quot;

The snake nods vigorously.
&quot;Where do you come from, anyway?&quot; You ask.
The snake jabs its tail at a little sign next to the glass. You peer at it.  Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
&quot;Was it nice there?&quot;

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and you read on. 
This specimen was bred in the zoo.
&quot;Oh, I see - so you&apos;ve never been to Brazil?&quot;
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind you made both you and the snake jump. &quot;DUDLEY! MR DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON&apos;T BELIEVE WHAT IT&apos;S DOING!&quot;

&quot;Out of the way, you&quot;, snarls Dudley, punching you in the ribs. You fall. When you look back at the snake&apos;s enclosure, you see Piers and Dudley jumping back with howls of horror. The glass has vanished, and the snake is slithering awat across the floor. 
&quot;Brazil, here I come ... Thankssss, amigo.&quot;

 You see everyone standing around, looking shocked. &quot;Well, we should go&quot;, says a rather uncomfortable looking Uncle Vernon. He steers you out to the carpark, and the rest of the group follows suit.
local zoo carpark (in car)
to the north is the zoo&apos;s entrance.

You can see a zoo entrance (in which is entrance lady) here.

As everyone gets into the car, Dudley and Piers start talking loudly about the snake. Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. &quot;Harry was talking to it, weren&apos;t you, Harry?&quot; says Piers. Uncle Vernon turns the colour of beetroot. The journey home seems to take an age.

&gt;[32] get out
You get out of car.

To the east is privet drive. 

You can see front door (west), car (in which are Aunt Petunia, Piers Polkiss, Dudley and Uncle Vernon) and garage (closed) here.

&quot;Bye Dudley&quot;, says Piers. The front door slams as he leaves. Uncle Vernon rounds on you, and says &quot;Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,&quot; before collapsing into a chair. Aunt Petunia runs to fetch him some brandy.

&quot;Get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don&apos;t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy&apos;s birthday.&quot; 
You see the kitchen door slam as Petunia walks through and closes it. The sound of the frying pan being put on the cooker emenates from the kitchen. You&apos;d better cook the breakfast.

Aunt Petunia enters the kitchen looking angry and worried. &quot;Bad news, Vernon. Mrs Figg&apos;s broken her leg. She can&apos;t take him&quot; she says, jerking her head towards you. Dudley looks horrified. &quot;He&apos;s not coming on my birthday!&quot;

&quot;Maybe you could just leave me here&quot; you suggest. 

&quot;And come back and find the house in ruins?&quot; says Aunt Petunia.

&quot;I won&apos;t blow up the house,&quot; you say.

&quot;I suppose we could take him to the zoo, and leave him in the car,&quot; says Aunt Petunia.
&quot;The car&apos;s new, he&apos;s not sitting in it alone...&quot;
Dudley begins to cry loudly. He&apos;s not really crying, it&apos;s been years since he&apos;s done that, But he knows that Aunt Petunia will give him anything he wants if he does.

That&apos;s the doorbell. Must be Piers Polkiss, Dudley&apos;s friend. Dudley&apos;s stopped pretending to cry.
&quot;Alright, let&apos;s go,&quot; says Petunia. Everyone leaves the kitchen and gets into the Dursley&apos;s car.

Time passes.

Uncle Vernon takes you aside. &quot;I&apos;m warning you, I&apos;m warning you now, boy - any funny business, anything at all - and you&apos;ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas. &quot; He proceeds, with some difficulty, to go through the front door.

&quot;Everyone here?&quot; says Uncle Vernon, craning his neck to check if everyone managed the short walk from the kitchen to the massively oversized and expensive company car.
&quot;Yes, let&apos;s go, let&apos;s go!&quot; chorus Dudley and Piers.

The car pulls out of the driveway.

Dudley and Piers immediately push past you to get to the entrance, where they&apos;re selling ice-creams. Uncle Vernon chuckles and hops out, buying them both a large, chocolate ice-cream.

&gt;[18] n
as you walk past, the lady at the entrance smiles and asks you if you would like something as well. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia look at each other, before getting you a cheap lemon ice lolly. They grab you and drag you away before the lady can bestow any more kindness on you.

&quot;Well, have a look around everyone!&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;We&apos;ve got a bit of time untill we have to go eat lunch. We should meet in the nocturnal animal ex... exh... er, room, when lunchtime comes around.&quot; 
Gorilla Enclosure
You can see a few people goggling through the bars at the rather bored looking gorillas. To the north is the bird room - to the south, the zoo entrance. to the east, the reptile house. and west, the monkeys exhibit.

You can see Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, Piers Polkiss and a Gorilla&apos;s cage (closed) (in which are three Gorillas) here.

After a while of looking around the exhibits, Dudley, who has a remarkably short attention span, starts complaining. &quot;I want to eat&quot;, he says. &quot;Ok&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;Let&apos;s go get some food. And Harry, Dudley lost his camera in one of the exhibits. If you want lunch anytime soon, go and get it for him.&quot; Dudley, Piers, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia leave without paying any attention to you. You&apos;ve got to find Dudley&apos;s camera, and then your way to the zoo&apos;s cafe.

You can see Piers Polkiss, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and Dudley here.

&gt;[32] look snake
The sign next to one of the snakes says &quot;Boa Constrictor, bred in Peru&quot;.

You wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it had died of boredom - with no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up - at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

The snake suddenly opened it&apos;s beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with yours.

It winked.

The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley,  then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: &quot;I get that all the time&quot;&quot;I know&quot;, you murmur through the glass, although you don&apos;t know if the snake can hear you. &quot;It must be really annoying.&quot;

The snake nods vigorously.
&quot;Where do you come from, anyway?&quot; You ask.
The snake jabs its tail at a little sign next to the glass. You peer at it.  Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
&quot;Was it nice there?&quot;

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and you read on. 
This specimen was bred in the zoo.
&quot;Oh, I see - so you&apos;ve never been to Brazil?&quot;
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind you made both you and the snake jump. &quot;DUDLEY! MR DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON&apos;T BELIEVE WHAT IT&apos;S DOING!&quot;

&quot;Out of the way, you&quot;, snarls Dudley, punching you in the ribs. You fall. When you look back at the snake&apos;s enclosure, you see Piers and Dudley jumping back with howls of horror. The glass has vanished, and the snake is slithering awat across the floor. 
&quot;Brazil, here I come ... Thankssss, amigo.&quot;

 You see everyone standing around, looking shocked. &quot;Well, we should go&quot;, says a rather uncomfortable looking Uncle Vernon. He steers you out to the carpark, and the rest of the group follows suit.
local zoo carpark (in car)
to the north is the zoo&apos;s entrance.

You can see a zoo entrance (in which is entrance lady) here.

As everyone gets into the car, Dudley and Piers start talking loudly about the snake. Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. &quot;Harry was talking to it, weren&apos;t you, Harry?&quot; says Piers. Uncle Vernon turns the colour of beetroot. The journey home seems to take an age.

&gt;[33] get out
You get out of car.

Garden
To the east is privet drive. 

You can see front door (west), car (in which are Aunt Petunia, Piers Polkiss, Dudley and Uncle Vernon) and garage (closed) here.

&gt;[34] w
&quot;Bye Dudley&quot;, says Piers. The front door slams as he leaves. Uncle Vernon rounds on you, and says &quot;Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,&quot; before collapsing into a chair. Aunt Petunia runs to fetch him some brandy.

&gt;[35] n

Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions.

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

&gt;[36] sleep
Exhausted by the day, you collapse into bed. You wait until night, so you can go and get food from the kitchen without the Dursleys catching you. In the meantime, you sit and think.

You have lived with the Dursleys for almost  ten years, ten miserable years, as long as you can remember, ever since you were a baby and your parents died in a car crash. 
You can&apos;t remember being there when your parents died. Sometimes, you can recall a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on your forehead. This, you suppose, was the crash, though you can&apos;t imagine where the green light might&apos;ve come from.

 You can&apos;t remember your parents, and the Dursleys never talked about them. He wasn&apos;t allowed to ask questions, and there were no photos of them in the house.

When you were younger, you had dreamed and dreamed of an unknown relation coming to tak you away, but this never happened; The Dursleys were your only family.

Yet, sometimes, it seemed as though strangers in the street seemed to know you. Very strange strangers they were, too.

A tiny man in a violet top had bowed to you once while out shopping, and a wild-looking old woman dressed in green had waved merrily to him once. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.

The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish, the second you tried to take a closer look.

At school, you have no one. Everybody knew that Dudley&apos;s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley&apos;s gang. 

Sometime during your musings, you fall asleep.

&gt;[37] get up
You wake up.

You get out of Bed.

Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions.

(first opening Cupboard door)

Hall
Dudley is here, with his friends Piers, Malcolm, Gordon, and half of Dennis; the other half of Dennis is out the front door, since they&apos;re too large to all fit into the one room. Though all of Dudley&apos;s friends are big and stupid, Dudley, being the biggest and stupidest of the lot, is the leader. They seem to be laughing at a story Dudley just told them about knocking Mrs Figg over while riding his bike for the first time. You&apos;d like to go outside for a walk, but they&apos;re blocking the way. Hang on, didn&apos;t Dudley have a broken air rifle? What if I could fix it?

You can see Cupboard door (north), Malcolm, Gordon, Dennis, Piers Polkiss, Dudley, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Staircase (up), a Dining room door (southwest), the living-room door (south), front door (east) and kitchen door (west) here.

You come into the kitchen in the morning to have your nostrils assaulted by a horrible smell. The smell seems to be coming from a container in the sink, full of grey water and rags. &quot;What is this?&quot;, you ask your Aunt. &quot;Your new school uniform&quot;, she says. &quot;I&apos;m dyeing some of Dudley&apos;s old things gray for you. It&apos;ll look just like everyone else&apos;s when i&apos;ve finished.&quot; Uncle Vernon and Dudley enter the room, their noses wrinkled from the smell of your uniform.

&gt;[50] look

You can see Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, kitchen door (east), a chair, kitchen table (on which is piece of toast), a cooker (on which is a the frying pan (empty)), fridge (closed) and sink here.

Uncle Vernon opens his newspaper, and Dudley bangs his Smeltings stick on the table. You hear the click of a letter-box and the sound of letters flopping on the doormat. Uncle Vernon tells Dudley to get it. Dudley tells you to get it. You tell Dudley to get it. Dudley tries to hit you with his Smeltings stick. You go to get the letters.

Your Aunt takes the toast and throws it out. &quot;How long has that been there?&quot; She asks. No-one answers her. She seems miffed that she isn&apos;t getting any attention.

I said, &quot;You get the letters. Don&apos;t stuff up the continuity of the story. It&apos;s rude.

&gt;[52] take mail
You pick up mail from the ground.

As you examine the mail, you see a postcard from Aunt Marge, who was on holiday, something that looked like a bill and - a letter for Harry. No one ever sends you letters, but here it was, a letter, adressed so plainly there could be no mistake:

Mr H. Potter
The Cupboard under the Stairs
4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey

The thick, yellowish envelope has a purple wax seal on the back, bearing a coat of arms. &quot;Hurry up, boy!&quot; shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. &quot;What are you doing, checking for letter-bombs?&quot; You hear him chuckling merrily.

&gt;[53] w
&quot;Finally&quot;, says Uncle Vernon. You give him the other letters, and keep your own.

kitchen
Uncle Vernon sits reading his mail, as you should be.

You can see kitchen door (east), Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon (hiding behind a newspaper), Dudley, a chair, kitchen table, a cooker (on which is a the frying pan (empty)), fridge (closed) and sink here.

&gt;[54] read mail
&quot;Marge&apos;s ill&quot;, Uncle Vernon informed Aunt Petunia. &quot;Ate a funny whelk...&quot;
&quot;Dad!&quot; said Dudley suddenly. &quot;Dad, Harry&apos;s got something!&quot;
Right before you unfold the heavy parchment letter, it is jerked sharply out of your hand by your Uncle.

&quot;That&apos;s mine!&quot;, you say, trying to snatch it back.
&quot;Who&apos;d be writing to you?&quot; sneered Uncle Vernon, glancing at the letter. His face turned green. &quot;P-P-Petunia!&quot; he gasped.

Dudley tried to grab the letter, but your Uncle held it out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. 
&quot;Vernon! Oh my goodness - Vernon!&quot;
&quot;I want to read it&quot; you say, at the same time as Dudley. &quot;Get out, both of you,&quot; croaks Uncle Vernon, &quot;OUT!&quot;, before he grabs both you and Dudley by the neck and throws you out of the room.

You can see kitchen door (west), Cupboard door (north), Dudley, Staircase (up), a Dining room door (southwest), the living-room door (south) and front door (east) here.

&gt;[55] listen
&quot;Vernon,&quot; Aunt Petunia says, &quot;look at the address - how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don&apos;t think they&apos;re watching the house?&quot;

&quot;Watching - spying - might be following us,&quot; mutters Uncle Vernon. 
&quot;What should we do? Write back?&quot; says your Aunt.
&quot;No, No, We&apos;ll ignore it. if they don&apos;t get an answer ... yes, that&apos;s best ... we won&apos;t do anything ...&quot;

&quot;But - &quot;
&quot;I&apos;m not having one in the house! Didn&apos;t we swear that we&apos;d stamp him out of this dangerous nonsense?&quot;

You can hear Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia walking around the room, muttering. Your cupboard door stands open.

&gt;[56] n
You spend the rest of the day thinking up ways of getting your letter back. After getting home from work, Uncle Vernon did something he&apos;d never done before: he visited you in your cupboard. &quot;Where&apos;s my letter?&quot; you ask. &quot;Who wrote to me?&quot;
&quot;No one. it was adressed to you by mistake,&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;I have burned it.&quot; &quot;It was not a mistake&quot;, you say. &quot;It had my cupboard on it.&quot;
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; yells Uncle Vernon. &quot;Er - yes, Harry - about this cupboard, We think you&apos;re getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley&apos;s second room. You can grab all your things and move up now.&quot;

You walk into the room and drop all of your things on the ground. Yesterday, you would&apos;ve given anything to be up here. Today, you would rather be in the cupboard, without it. From downstairs, you hear the sound of Dudley complaining about you taking his room, mingled with the sound of Uncle Vernon yelling. It appears that more letters were forced through the letter-box, through the crack between the door and the wall, and the window in the downstairs toilet. Over the next few days, more letters find their way into the house. 

One fine Sunday morning, after waking, Aunt Petunia calls you for breakfast.

Uncle Vernon comes into the room. &quot;No post on Sundays,&quot; he reminded them all happily, &quot;no damn letters today -&quot;
Something came whizzing down the chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters pelt out of the fireplace. While the others duck, You jump and try to catch one - 
&quot;Out! OUT!&quot;

Uncle Vernon seizes you around the waist and throws you into the hall, while the others run after. The kitchen door closes behind them. &quot;That does it.&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;I want you all ready to leave in five minutes. We&apos;re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!&quot;

Ten minutes later, everyone was in the car, speeding along the highway. They drove. And drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn&apos;t dare ask where they were going. After spending the night in a hotel, the family was back on the road again.
 &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be better just to go home, dear?&quot; Aunt Petunia suggested. Uncle Vernon pays no attention. After hours of roaming, the car stops at the coast and Uncle Vernon gets out, locking the door at the same time. After a while, Dudley starts complaining. &quot;It&apos;s Monday, and the Great Humberto&apos;s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with television.&quot;
If it is Monday, then it&apos;s your birthday tomorrow. Of course, your birthdays are never very fun - last year, you recieved a coat-hanger and a pair of old socks that used to belong to Uncle Vernon. Still, you weren&apos;t eleven every day.

Uncle Vernon comes, smiling, back to the car, carrying a long, thin package, which he wouldn&apos;t tell Petunia about. &quot;Found the perfect place!&quot; he says. &quot;Come on! Everyone out!&quot;
You walk along the coast, before coming to a halt in front of an old rowing boat which your Uncle says was lent to you buy the  toothless old man standing next to him. Everyone hops into the boat, and are soon rowing towards a small, miserable looking shack on a rock in the middle of the ocean.

After reaching the rock, everyone gratefully clambers out of the boat. The shack smells horribly like seaweed. Uncle Vernon, who promised he&apos;d brought rations, turned out to be in possession of four packets of crisps, and four bananas. After eating, he chucks the empty crisp packets into the fire and tries to light it, but they just shrivel up. &quot;Could do with some of those letters now, eh?&quot; he says. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon go into the only other room, and Dudley sleeps on the sofa. You get the floor. You check Dudley&apos;s watch, on his arm which is sticking over the side of the sofa. 

Five minutes to go.

Shack
There is another small room to the east.

You can see a the shack&apos;s door (west), sofa, fireplace (empty), blanket and a window (closed) here.

BOOM. The whole shack shivered. You sit bolt upright. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. 
BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. &quot;Where&apos;s the cannon?&quot; he said stupidly. 
There was a crash as Uncle Vernon skidded into the room, holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what was in the package that he had brought with him.
&quot;Who&apos;s there?&quot; he shouted. &quot;I warn you - I&apos;m armed!;
There was a pause. Then -
SMASH!
The door was knocked off of its hinges and landed on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. The giant squeezed his way into the hut. He picked up the door and fitted it back into it&apos;s frame. He turned around to look at them. 
&quot;Couldn&apos;t make us a cup o&quot; tea, could yeh? It&apos;s not been an easy journey...&quot;
 The stranger strolled over to the sofa and told Dudley to move. Dudley instead ran squeaking over to his parents. 
&quot;An here&apos;s Harry!&quot; said the giant.
&gt;[69] look
Shack
There is another small room to the east.

You can see Hagrid, Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, Dudley, a the shack&apos;s door (west), sofa, fireplace (in which is fire), blanket and a window (closed) here.

&quot;I demand that you leave at one, sir!&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;You are breaking and entering!&quot;
The giant wrenched the gun out of Uncle Vernon&apos;s hands, and bent it into a knot, before throwing it aside. 
&quot;I haven&quot; seen you since you was only a baby. I&apos;m Hagrid, by the way. Rubeus Hagrid. I got summat for yeh - it&apos;s in my coat. Here you go.&quot; 

He gives you a box which he removed from his jacket, which, upon opening, contained a large chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. &quot;You wouldn&apos; mind making some tea and sausages, would yeh? they&apos;re in my coat. Start by getting out the tea pot and puttin&apos; some tea leaves in it. Then go to the other room to get some water.&quot; Hagrid bent down in front of the fire, and when he stood up a fire was roaring in the grate. 

&gt;[70] open pocket

You open pocket, revealing teapot and tea leaves.


&gt;[71] take all
hagrid&apos;s coat: That&apos;s not yours.
cake: You pick up cake from the ground.


blanket: You pick up blanket from the ground.


teapot: 
You take teapot from pocket.
tea leaves: 
You take tea leaves from pocket.
letter: That seems to belong to Uncle Vernon.

Second bedroom
The small room in which your aunt and uncle sleep. The door is to the west.

You can see a mouldy old bed (empty) and Dirty sink (in which is water) here.


&gt;[73] fill kettle with water
You must supply a second noun.
You fill the teapot with water. From the other room, Hagrid calls out to you. &quot;How&apos;re you going there, Harry? anyway, I&apos;m the keeper of keys at Hogwarts. Yeh&apos;ll know all about Hogwarts, o&apos; course. 
&quot;Er, no&quot; you call back. &quot;Sorry&quot;.

&quot;Sorry?&quot; barks Hagrid. &quot;It&apos;s them that should be sorry! I knew you weren&apos;t getting the letters, but I still thought you&apos;d know about Hogwarts, fer crying out loud! Didn&apos;t you ever wonder where your parents learnt it all?

&quot;All what?&quot;

&quot;ALL WHAT! Don&apos; you know - Don&apos;t you know anything, about yer parents world?

&quot;What world?

&quot;DURSLEY!&quot; booms Hagrid.

&gt;[74] w
As you enter, Hagrid says &quot;You never told him? You kept it from him for all these years?&quot;

&quot;Kept what from me?&quot; you ask eagerly.

&quot;STOP! I FORBID YOU!&quot; says Uncle Vernon, panicking.

&quot;Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,&quot; says Hagrid. &quot;Ruddy great Muggles. Harry - yer a wizard.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m a what?&quot; you ask. 
&quot;A wizard, and a good one i&apos;d reckon, once yer trained up a bit. It&apos;s time you read your  letter.&quot; Hagrid hands you a letter.
You unfold the letter and read: 

HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITHCRAFT AND WIZADRY

Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,
Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards

Dear Mr Potter,
    We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
    Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. 

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress.



You look up. &quot;What does it mean, they await my owl?&quot;
Hagrid, appearing to just have his memory jogged, reaches inside one of his coat&apos;s many pockets, and extracts a real, live owl. He also extracts a quill and a roll of parchment. You read the letter he is writing upside down:

Dear Mr Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather&apos;s horrible. Hope you&apos;re well.
Hagrid

He rolls it up, and gives it to the owl, which takes the letter and flies out the window. Uncle Vernon regains his courage. &quot;I WILL NOT PAY FOR SOME CRAKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!&quot; he yells. He had gone too far. Hagrid seizes his umbrella, and thunders &quot;NEVER - INSULT - ALBUS - DUMBLEDORE - IN - FRONT - OF - ME!&quot;

He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air, and the next second there was a cracking sound, and Dudley was dancing around, holding his fat bottom. When he turned, they saw a pigs tail stiching out of a hole in his pyjamas. Dudley&apos;s parents grabbed him and threw him into the next room, before slamming the door shut. &quot;Alright Harry, it&apos;d do to get some sleep before tomorrow. Here, use this.&quot; says Hagrid. He gives you his coat to sleep under, which you promptly do. 
You wake next morning.

&gt;[75] look
You keep your eyes screwed shut, knowing that the events of yesterday where a dream. You are at home in your cupboard, waiting for your Aunt to knock on the door. Waiting for her to knock...


&gt;[76] listen
You hear a loud tapping noise. There&apos;s Aunt Petunia, you think, come to wake you up. You wished that yesterday was real, that you really where going off to a wizards school. You open your eyes, to the sight of the dark, damp hut. The tapping is coming from an owl, by the closed window. Hagrid is lying in a corner, snoring loudly.


there&apos;s nothing to hear.


&gt;[77] open window
You open the window, and the owl flies in. The owl drops a newspaper on Hagrid, before beginning to attack Hagrid&apos;s coat. &quot;Hagrid, there&apos;s an owl&quot;, you say. &quot;Pay &apos;im&quot;, responds Hagrid. &quot;There&apos;s money in one o&apos; my coat pockets. Give him five Knuts. They&apos;re the little bronze ones. The Silver ones&apos;re called Sickles, and the gold are Galleons.&quot;


&gt;[78] open pocket
You open one of the pockets at random, and find a large bunch of keys. Another pocket yields mint humbugs. Then you find slug pellets, and three more packets of sausages, before finally stumbling across a bag of strange-looking coins.


&gt;[79] open bag of coins
The owl holds out its leg, displaying a little, open pouch. It watches you expectantly.


&gt;[80] take 5 knuts
Knut: 
You take the Knut from bag of coins.
Knut: 
You take the Knut from bag of coins.
Knut: 
You take the Knut from bag of coins.
Knut: 
You take the Knut from bag of coins.
Knut: 
You take the Knut from bag of coins.


&gt;[81] put 5 knuts in pouch
Knut: 
Done.
Knut: 
Done.
Knut: 
Done.
Knut: 
Done.
Knut: 
Done.


The owl flutters out the open window. Hagrid gets up, yawning loudly, and says &quot;Best be off Harry. Lots to do.&quot; He notices you looking at the coins in the bag, and says &quot;I wouldn&apos; worry &apos;bout money; Your parents left you some. It&apos;s in the wizard&apos;s bank, Gringotts.  We&apos;ll go there soon enough.&quot; Hagrid takes his coat and walks out the door.

&gt;[82] w
(first opening the the shack&apos;s door)

rock
You can see Uncle Vernon&apos;s borrowed rowing boat bobbing in the water.

You can see a the shack&apos;s door (east), Hagrid and boat (empty) here.

&quot;Well, get in Harry&quot;, says Hagrid.

&gt;[83] get in
Hagrid jumps in the boat next to you, squishing you against the side. He looks at the boat. &quot;Seems a shame to row&quot;, he says. He glances over his shoulder, before saying &quot;If I sped things up a bit, would you mind not mentioning it at Hogwarts?&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; you say. Hagrid retrieves his pink umbrella from inside his coat and taps the side of the boat. The boat sped away towards the harbour. &quot;Hagrid, what&apos;s a muggle?&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s what we call non-magic folk, and your family are the biggest group o&apos; muggles I&apos;ve ever seen, and I don&apos;t just mean physical size!&quot;

&quot;What about my parents?&quot; you ask.
Hagrid sighs. &quot;Your parents were a great witch and wizard, but even the greatest aren&apos;t invulnerable.  I can&apos;t tell yeh everythin&apos;, Because no-one knows all of it... 
It begins with a person called - called -&quot;
&quot;Called what?&quot; you ask.

&quot;Blimey, it&apos;s incredible you don&apos;t know his name, everyone in our world does - I don&apos; like sayin&apos; the name if I don&apos;t have to, and I&apos;m not alone in that.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because people are still scared, even after all this time... See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. His name was... was 
&quot;Was what?&quot;

&quot;Voldemort.&quot; 
Hagrid shuddered. &quot;Anyway, about 20 years ago, he started gathering followers, and he found loads of people. Some afraid, and some just power hungry, because he had power. Dark days, Harry. Didn&apos;t know who you could trust. Hogwarts was one o&apos; the only safe places left, because of Dumbledore, the headmaster. Your mum and dad were at Hogwarts then, and as good a witch and wizard as I ever knew. They were close to Dumbledore. 
And then, one day, at Hallowe&apos;en ten years ago, he went to find them. He came to your house, and -&quot;
Hagrid pulled a spotted handkerchief out of his pocket and blew his nose. 
&quot;You-know-who killed your parents. And then - and this is the mysterious bit - he tried to kill you too. Turned his wand on you, and ended up destroying himself, while you just got a scar. No one knows what happened to him afterwards, except that he hasn&apos;t been seen since. I took you from the house personally, took you to the muggles, and you&apos;d know the rest better than I would,&quot; he says, sighing. The boat bumps up against the harbor wall, and you climb out onto the street.

street
The station is to your west. Passers-by stare at you as you walk through the street. Hagrid being twice as tall as a normal man, and the way he kept pointing out ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly &quot;See that Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?&quot;, might&apos;ve had something to do with it.

You can see Hagrid, boat (empty) and Passers-by here.

&gt;[84] w
&quot;Now, I don&apos;t understand this muggle money,&quot; says Hagrid. &quot;Can you please go and buy tickets from the machine? Here&apos;s some money.&quot;

The train rushes into the station. Hagrid grabs your arm and drags you onto the train. &quot;Now, have you still got that letter? It&apos;s got a list of your school things inside it.&quot; .

&quot;Can we buy all of this in London?&quot; you ask. 
&quot;If you know where to go&quot;, says Hagrid. &quot;Hey look, we&apos;re here!&quot;
Hagrid pulls you off the train and into a small bar. &quot;This, Harry, is the leaky cauldron.&quot;
leaky cauldron
The leaky cauldron is small, dark and shabby. A few old women sit in one corner, drinking sherry. The barman was talking to a little man in a top hat. Everyone seems to know Hagrid. 

You can see a rusty old door (east), Tom, bar (on which is drink), Dedalus Diggle, Professor Quirrell, Doris Crockford, a small table, five chairs and five old women here.

The barman asks &quot;The usual, Hagrid?&quot;
&quot;Can&apos;t. Tom, I&apos;m on Hogwarts Business. I&apos;m taking Harry here to buy his school things.&quot;

The room goes quiet. &quot;Good lord. Can it be... can it be Harry Potter?&quot;
What seems like the entire bar queues up to shake your hand; some keep coming back. 
&quot;Welcome back Mr Potter, Welcome back!&quot;
&quot;So proud, Mr Potter, I&apos;m just so proud - &quot;
&quot;P-P-Potter, c-can&apos;t tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.&quot;
&quot;Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He&apos;s a Hogwarts teacher.&quot; says Hagrid.

HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITHCRAFT AND WIZADRY

Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,
Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards

Dear Mr Potter,
    We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress.



You look up. &quot;What does it mean, they await my owl?&quot;
Hagrid, appearing to just have his memory jogged, reaches inside one of his coat&apos;s many pockets, and extracts a real, live owl. He also extracts a quill and a roll of parchment. You read the letter he is writing upside down:
Dear Mr Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather&apos;s horrible. Hope you&apos;re well.
Hagrid
He rolls it up, and gives it to the owl, which takes the letter and flies out the window. &quot;Alright Harry, it&apos;d do to get some sleep before tomorrow. Here, use this.&quot; says Hagrid. He gives you his coat to sleep under, which you promptly do. 
You wake next morning.

The owl flutters out the open window. Hagrid gets up, yawning loudly, and says &quot;Best be off Harry. Lots to do.&quot; He notices you looking at the coins in the bag, and says &quot;I wouldn&apos; worry &apos;bout money; Your parents left you some. It&apos;s in the wizard&apos;s bank, Gringotts.

You can see hagrid&apos;s coat, cake, owl, Hagrid, Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, Dudley, sofa, fireplace (in which is fire) and a window (empty) here.

&quot;Can we buy all of this in London?&quot; you ask. 
&quot;If you know where to go&quot;, says Hagrid. &quot;Hey look, we&apos;re here!&quot;
Hagrid pulls you off the train and into a small bar. &quot;This, Harry, is the leaky cauldron.&quot;
leaky cauldron
The leaky cauldron is small, dark and shabby. A few old women sit in one corner, drinking sherry. The barman was talking to a little man in a top hat. Everyone seems to know Hagrid. 

The barman asks &quot;The usual, Hagrid?&quot;
&quot;Can&apos;t. Tom, I&apos;m on Hogwarts Business. I&apos;m taking Harry here to buy his school things.&quot;

The room goes quiet. &quot;Good lord. Can it be... can it be Harry Potter?&quot;
What seems like the entire bar queues up to shake your hand; some keep coming back. 
&quot;Welcome back Mr Potter, Welcome back!&quot;
&quot;So proud, Mr Potter, I&apos;m just so proud - &quot;
&quot;P-P-Potter, c-can&apos;t tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.&quot;
&quot;Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He&apos;s a Hogwarts teacher.&quot; says hagrid.

HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITHCRAFT AND WIZADRY

Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,
Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards

Dear Mr Potter,
    We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
    Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. 

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress.


[(1) examining letter - succeeded]


You look up. &quot;What does it mean, they await my owl?&quot;
Hagrid, appearing to just have his memory jogged, reaches inside one of his coat&apos;s many pockets, and extracts a real, live owl. He also extracts a quill and a roll of parchment. You read the letter he is writing upside down:
Dear Mr Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather&apos;s horrible. Hope you&apos;re well.
Hagrid
He rolls it up, and gives it to the owl, which takes the letter and flies out the window. &quot;Alright Harry, it&apos;d do to get some sleep before tomorrow. Here, use this.&quot; says Hagrid. He gives you his coat to sleep under, which you promptly do. 
You wake next morning.

He gives you a box which he removed from his jacket, which, upon opening, contained a large chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. &quot;You wouldn&apos; mind making some tea and sausages, would yeh? they&apos;re in my coat. Start by getting out the tea pot and puttin&apos; some tea leaves in it.

&quot;Er, no&quot; you call back. &quot;Sorry&quot;.

&quot;Sorry?&quot; barks Hagrid. &quot;It&apos;s them that should be sorry! I knew you weren&apos;t getting the letters, but I still thought you&apos;d know about Hogwarts, fer crying out loud! Didn&apos;t you ever wonder where your parents learnt it all?

&quot;All what?&quot;

&quot;ALL WHAT! Don&apos; you know - Don&apos;t you know anything, about yer parents world?

&quot;What world?

&quot;DURSLEY!&quot; booms Hagrid.

&quot;A wizard, and a good one i&apos;d reckon, once yer trained up a bit. It&apos;s time you read your  letter.&quot; Hagrid hands you a letter.
You unfold the letter and read: 

HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITHCRAFT AND WIZADRY

Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,
Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards

Dear Mr Potter,
    We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
    Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. 

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress.



You look up. &quot;What does it mean, they await my owl?&quot;
Hagrid, appearing to just have his memory jogged, reaches inside one of his coat&apos;s many pockets, and extracts a real, live owl. He also extracts a quill and a roll of parchment. You read the letter he is writing upside down:
Dear Mr Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather&apos;s horrible. Hope you&apos;re well.
Hagrid
He rolls it up, and gives it to the owl, which takes the letter and flies out the window. &quot;Alright Harry, it&apos;d do to get some sleep before tomorrow. Here, use this.&quot; says Hagrid. He gives you his coat to sleep under, which you promptly do. 
You wake next morning.

The owl flutters out the open window. Hagrid gets up, yawning loudly, and says &quot;Best be off Harry. Lots to do.&quot; He notices you looking at the coins in the bag, and says &quot;I wouldn&apos; worry &apos;bout money; Your parents left you some. It&apos;s in the wizard&apos;s bank, Gringotts.

&quot;Voldemort.&quot; 
Hagrid shuddered. &quot;Anyway, about 20 years ago, he started gathering followers, and he found loads of people. Some afraid, and some just power hungry, because he had power. Dark days, Harry. Didn&apos;t know who you could trust. Hogwarts was one o&apos; the only safe places left, because of Dumbledore, the headmaster. Your mum and dad were at Hogwarts then, and as good a witch and wizard as I ever knew. They were close to Dumbledore. 
And then, one day, at Hallowe&apos;en ten years ago, he went to find them. He came to your house, and -&quot;
Hagrid pulled a spotted handkerchief out of his pocket and blew his nose. 
&quot;You-know-who killed your parents. And then - and this is the mysterious bit - he tried to kill you too. Turned his wand on you, and ended up destroying himself, while you just got a scar. No one knows what happened to him afterwards, except that he hasn&apos;t been seen since. I took you from the house personally, took you to the muggles, and you&apos;d know the rest better than I would,&quot; he says, sighing.

leaky cauldron
The leaky cauldron is small, dark and shabby. A few old women sit in one corner, drinking sherry. The barman was talking to a little man in a top hat. Everyone seems to know Hagrid. 

You can see Hagrid, a rusty old door (east), Tom, bar (on which is drink), Dedalus Diggle, Professor Quirrell, Doris Crockford, a small table, five chairs and five old women here.

&quot;Can we buy all of this in London?&quot; you ask. 
&quot;If you know where to go&quot;, says Hagrid. &quot;Hey look, we&apos;re here!&quot;
Hagrid pulls you off the train and into a small bar. &quot;This, Harry, is the leaky cauldron.&quot;
leaky cauldron
The leaky cauldron is small, dark and shabby. A few old women sit in one corner, drinking sherry. The barman was talking to a little man in a top hat. Everyone seems to know Hagrid. 

You can see a rusty old door (east), Tom, bar (on which is drink), Dedalus Diggle, Professor Quirrell, Doris Crockford, a small table, five chairs and five old women here.

The barman asks &quot;The usual, Hagrid?&quot;
&quot;Can&apos;t. Tom, I&apos;m on Hogwarts Business. I&apos;m taking Harry here to buy his school things.&quot;

The room goes quiet. &quot;Good lord. Can it be... can it be Harry Potter?&quot;
What seems like the entire bar queues up to shake your hand; some keep coming back. 
&quot;Welcome back Mr Potter, Welcome back!&quot;
&quot;So proud, Mr Potter, I&apos;m just so proud - &quot;
&quot;P-P-Potter, c-can&apos;t tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.&quot;
&quot;Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He&apos;s a Hogwarts teacher.&quot; says Hagrid.

&quot;Get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don&apos;t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy&apos;s birthday.&quot; 
You see the kitchen door slam as Petunia walks through and closes it. The sound of the frying pan being put on the cooker emenates from the kitchen. You&apos;d better cook the breakfast.

Aunt Petunia enters the kitchen looking angry and worried. &quot;Bad news, Vernon. Mrs Figg&apos;s broken her leg. She can&apos;t take him&quot; she says, jerking her head towards you. Dudley looks horrified. &quot;He&apos;s not coming on my birthday!&quot;

&quot;Maybe you could just leave me here&quot; you suggest. 

&quot;And come back and find the house in ruins?&quot; says Aunt Petunia.

&quot;I won&apos;t blow up the house,&quot; you say.

&quot;I suppose we could take him to the zoo, and leave him in the car,&quot; says Aunt Petunia.
&quot;The car&apos;s new, he&apos;s not sitting in it alone...&quot;
Dudley begins to cry loudly. He&apos;s not really crying, it&apos;s been years since he&apos;s done that, But he knows that Aunt Petunia will give him anything he wants if he does.

That&apos;s the doorbell. Must be Piers Polkiss, Dudley&apos;s friend. Dudley&apos;s stopped pretending to cry.
&quot;Alright, let&apos;s go,&quot; says Petunia. Everyone leaves the kitchen and gets into the Dursley&apos;s car.

&gt;[8] wait
Time passes.

&gt;[9] e
Uncle Vernon takes you aside. &quot;I&apos;m warning you, I&apos;m warning you now, boy - any funny business, anything at all - and you&apos;ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas. &quot; He proceeds, with some difficulty, to go through the front door.

You open car.

&gt;[12] get in car
&quot;Everyone here?&quot; says Uncle Vernon, craning his neck to check if everyone managed the short walk from the kitchen to the massively oversized and expensive company car.
&quot;Yes, let&apos;s go, let&apos;s go!&quot; chorus Dudley and Piers.

The car pulls out of the driveway.

highway (in car)
The highway is filled with large company cars like your uncle&apos;s, and people roaring around on motorbikes.

In car you can see Uncle Vernon, Piers Polkiss, Dudley and Aunt Petunia.

&quot;...roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,&quot; says Uncle Vernon.

Dudley and Piers immediately push past you to get to the entrance, where they&apos;re selling ice-creams. Uncle Vernon chuckles and hops out, buying them both a large, chocolate ice-cream.

&gt;[17] n
as you walk past, the lady at the entrance smiles and asks you if you would like something as well. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia look at each other, before getting you a cheap lemon ice lolly. They grab you and drag you away before the lady can bestow any more kindness on you.

&quot;Well, have a look around everyone!&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;We&apos;ve got a bit of time untill we have to go eat lunch. We should meet in the nocturnal animal ex... exh... er, room, when lunchtime comes around.&quot; 
Gorilla Enclosure
You can see a few people goggling through the bars at the rather bored looking gorillas. To the north is the bird room - to the south, the zoo entrance. to the east, the reptile house. and west, the monkeys exhibit.

You can see Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, Piers Polkiss and a Gorilla&apos;s cage (closed) (in which are three Gorillas) here.

After a while of looking around the exhibits, Dudley, who has a remarkably short attention span, starts complaining. &quot;I want to eat&quot;, he says. &quot;Ok&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;Let&apos;s go get some food. And Harry, Dudley lost his camera in one of the exhibits. If you want lunch anytime soon, go and get it for him.&quot; Dudley, Piers, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia leave without paying any attention to you. You&apos;ve got to find Dudley&apos;s camera, and then your way to the zoo&apos;s cafe.

You can see Piers Polkiss, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and Dudley here.

&gt;[31] look snake
The sign next to one of the snakes says &quot;Boa Constrictor, bred in Peru&quot;.

You wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it had died of boredom - with no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up - at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

The snake suddenly opened it&apos;s beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with yours.

It winked.

The snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley,  then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: &quot;I get that all the time&quot;&quot;I know&quot;, you murmur through the glass, although you don&apos;t know if the snake can hear you. &quot;It must be really annoying.&quot;

The snake nods vigorously.
&quot;Where do you come from, anyway?&quot; You ask.
The snake jabs its tail at a little sign next to the glass. You peer at it.  Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
&quot;Was it nice there?&quot;

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and you read on. 
This specimen was bred in the zoo.
&quot;Oh, I see - so you&apos;ve never been to Brazil?&quot;
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind you made both you and the snake jump. &quot;DUDLEY! MR DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON&apos;T BELIEVE WHAT IT&apos;S DOING!&quot;

&quot;Out of the way, you&quot;, snarls Dudley, punching you in the ribs. You fall. When you look back at the snake&apos;s enclosure, you see Piers and Dudley jumping back with howls of horror. The glass has vanished, and the snake is slithering awat across the floor. 
&quot;Brazil, here I come ... Thankssss, amigo.&quot;

 You see everyone standing around, looking shocked. &quot;Well, we should go&quot;, says a rather uncomfortable looking Uncle Vernon. He steers you out to the carpark, and the rest of the group follows suit.
local zoo carpark (in car)
to the north is the zoo&apos;s entrance.

You can see a zoo entrance (in which is entrance lady) here.

As everyone gets into the car, Dudley and Piers start talking loudly about the snake. Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. &quot;Harry was talking to it, weren&apos;t you, Harry?&quot; says Piers. Uncle Vernon turns the colour of beetroot. The journey home seems to take an age.

&gt;[32] get out
You get out of car.

Garden
To the east is privet drive. 

You can see front door (west), car (in which are Aunt Petunia, Piers Polkiss, Dudley and Uncle Vernon) and garage (closed) here.

&gt;[33] w
&quot;Bye Dudley&quot;, says Piers. The front door slams as he leaves. Uncle Vernon rounds on you, and says &quot;Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,&quot; before collapsing into a chair. Aunt Petunia runs to fetch him some brandy.

&gt;[34] n

Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions.

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

&gt;[35] sleep
Exhausted by the day, you collapse into bed. You wait until night, so you can go and get food from the kitchen without the Dursleys catching you. In the meantime, you sit and think.

You have lived with the Dursleys for almost  ten years, ten miserable years, as long as you can remember, ever since you were a baby and your parents died in a car crash. 
You can&apos;t remember being there when your parents died. Sometimes, you can recall a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on your forehead. This, you suppose, was the crash, though you can&apos;t imagine where the green light might&apos;ve come from.

 You can&apos;t remember your parents, and the Dursleys never talked about them. He wasn&apos;t allowed to ask questions, and there were no photos of them in the house.

When you were younger, you had dreamed and dreamed of an unknown relation coming to tak you away, but this never happened; The Dursleys were your only family.

Yet, sometimes, it seemed as though strangers in the street seemed to know you. Very strange strangers they were, too.

A tiny man in a violet top had bowed to you once while out shopping, and a wild-looking old woman dressed in green had waved merrily to him once. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.

The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish, the second you tried to take a closer look.

At school, you have no one. Everybody knew that Dudley&apos;s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley&apos;s gang. 

Sometime during your musings, you fall asleep.

&gt;[36] get up
You wake up.

You get out of Bed.

Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions.

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

&gt;[37] s
(first opening Cupboard door)
You can&apos;t open the door. Uncle Vernon must&apos;ve locked it. You play a few games of chess against yourself and climb back into bed. Around  noon, Aunt Petunia appears to give you some food. Every day, after getting home from school, this schedule continues. You finally get let out at the end of the Summer holidays. 

Hall
Dudley is here, with his friends Piers, Malcolm, Gordon, and half of Dennis; the other half of Dennis is out the front door, since they&apos;re too large to all fit into the one room. Though all of Dudley&apos;s friends are big and stupid, Dudley, being the biggest and stupidest of the lot, is the leader. They seem to be laughing at a story Dudley just told them about knocking Mrs Figg over while riding his bike for the first time. You&apos;d like to go outside, but they&apos;re blocking the way.

You can see Cupboard door (north), Malcolm, Gordon, Dennis, Piers Polkiss, Dudley, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Staircase (up), a Dining room door (southwest), the living-room door (south), front door (east) and kitchen door (west) here.

You come into the kitchen in the morning to have your nostrils assaulted by a horrible smell. The smell seems to be coming from a container in the sink, full of grey water and rags. &quot;What is this?&quot;, you ask your Aunt. &quot;Your new school uniform&quot;, she says. &quot;I&apos;m dyeing some of Dudley&apos;s old things gray for you. It&apos;ll look just like everyone else&apos;s when i&apos;ve finished.&quot; Uncle Vernon and Dudley enter the room, their noses wrinkled from the smell of your uniform.

You can see Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, kitchen door (east), a chair, kitchen table (on which is piece of toast), a cooker (on which is a the frying pan (empty)), fridge (closed) and sink here.

Uncle Vernon opens his newspaper, and Dudley bangs his Smeltings stick on the table. You hear the click of a letter-box and the sound of letters flopping on the doormat. Uncle Vernon tells Dudley to get it. Dudley tells you to get it. You tell Dudley to get it. Dudley tries to hit you with his Smeltings stick. You get the letters.

Your Aunt takes the toast and throws it out. &quot;How long has that been there?&quot; She asks. No-one answers her. She seems miffed that she isn&apos;t getting any attention.

&gt;[51] take mail
You pick up mail from the ground.

As you examine the mail, you see a postcard from Aunt Marge, who was on holiday, something that looked like a bill and - a letter for Harry. No one ever sends you letters, but here it was, a letter, adressed so plainly there could be no mistake:

Mr H. Potter
The Cupboard under the Stairs
4 Privet Drive
Little Whinging
Surrey

The thick, yellowish envelope has a purple wax seal on the back, bearing a coat of arms. &quot;Hurry up, boy!&quot; shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. &quot;What are you doing, checking for letter-bombs?&quot; You hear him chuckling merrily.

&gt;[52] w
&quot;Finally&quot;, says Uncle Vernon. You give him the other letters, and keep your own.

Uncle Vernon sits reading his mail, as you should be

You can see kitchen door (east), Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon (hiding behind a newspaper), Dudley, a chair, kitchen table, a cooker (on which is a the frying pan (empty)), fridge (closed) and sink here.

&gt;[53] read mail
&quot;Marge&apos;s ill&quot;, Uncle Vernon informed Aunt Petunia. &quot;Ate a funny whelk...&quot;
&quot;Dad!&quot; said Dudley suddenly. &quot;Dad, Harry&apos;s got something!&quot;
Right before you unfold the heavy parchment letter, it is jerked sharply out of your hand by your Uncle.

&quot;That&apos;s mine!&quot;, you say, trying to snatch it back.
&quot;Who&apos;d be writing to you?&quot; sneered Uncle Vernon, glancing at the letter. His face turned green. &quot;P-P-Petunia!&quot; he gasped.

Dudley tried to grab the letter, but your Uncle held it out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. 
&quot;Vernon! Oh my goodness - Vernon!&quot;
&quot;I want to read it&quot; you say, at the same time as Dudley. &quot;Get out, both of you,&quot; croaks Uncle Vernon, &quot;OUT!&quot;, before he grabs both you and Dudley by the neck and throws you out of the room.

Hall
You can hear Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia arguing.

You can see kitchen door (west), Cupboard door (north), Dudley, Staircase (up), a Dining room door (southwest), the living-room door (south) and front door (east) here.

&gt;[54] listen
&quot;Vernon,&quot; Aunt Petunia says, &quot;look at the address - how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don&apos;t think they&apos;re watching the house?&quot;

&quot;Watching - spying - might be following us,&quot; mutters Uncle Vernon. 
&quot;What should we do? Write back?&quot; says your Aunt.
&quot;No, No, We&apos;ll ignore it. if they don&apos;t get an answer ... yes, that&apos;s best ... we won&apos;t do anything ...&quot;

&quot;But - &quot;
&quot;I&apos;m not having one in the house! Didn&apos;t we swear that we&apos;d stamp him out of this dangerous nonsense?&quot;

You can hear Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia walking around the room, muttering. Your cupboard door stands open.

&gt;[55] n
You spend the rest of the day thinking up ways of getting your letter back. After getting home from work, Uncle Vernon did something he&apos;d never done before: he visited you in your cupboard. &quot;Where&apos;s my letter?&quot; you ask. &quot;Who wrote to me?&quot;
&quot;No one. it was adressed to you by mistake,&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;I have burned it.&quot; &quot;It was not a mistake&quot;, you say. &quot;It had my cupboard on it.&quot;
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; yells Uncle Vernon. &quot;Er - yes, Harry - about this cupboard, We think you&apos;re getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley&apos;s second room. You can grab all your things and move up now.&quot;

You walk into the room and drop all of your things on the ground. Yesterday, you would&apos;ve given anything to be up here. Today, you would rather be in the cupboard, without it. From downstairs, you hear the sound of Dudley complaining about you taking his room, mingled with the sound of Uncle Vernon yelling. It appears that more letters were forced through the letter-box, through the crack between the door and the wall, and the window in the downstairs toilet. Over the next few days, more letters find their way into the house. 

One fine Sunday morning, after waking, Aunt Petunia calls you for breakfast.

You see Uncle Vernon sitting in front of the letterbox, boarding it up.

You can see Staircase (up), a Dining room door (southwest), the living-room door (south), front door (east), kitchen door (west) and Cupboard door (north) here.

&gt;[62] w
Uncle Vernon comes into the room. &quot;No post on Sundays,&quot; he reminded them all happily, &quot;no damn letters today -&quot;
Something came whizzing down the chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters pelt out of the fireplace. While the others duck, You jump and try to catch one - 
&quot;Out! OUT!&quot;

Uncle Vernon seizes you around the waist and throws you into the hall, while the others run after. The kitchen door closes behind them. &quot;That does it.&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;I want you all ready to leave in five minutes. We&apos;re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!&quot;

Ten minutes later, everyone was in the car, speeding along the highway. They drove. And drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn&apos;t dare ask where they were going. After spending the night in a hotel, the family was back on the road again.
 &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be better just to go home, dear?&quot; Aunt Petunia suggested. Uncle Vernon pays no attention. After hours of roaming, the car stops at the coast and Uncle Vernon gets out, locking the door at the same time. After a while, Dudley starts complaining. &quot;It&apos;s Monday, and the Great Humberto&apos;s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with television.&quot;
If it is Monday, then it&apos;s your birthday tomorrow. Of course, your birthdays are never very fun - last year, you recieved a coat-hanger and a pair of old socks that used to belong to Uncle Vernon. Still, you weren&apos;t eleven every day.

Uncle Vernon comes, smiling, back to the car, carrying a long, thin package, which he wouldn&apos;t tell Petunia about. &quot;Found the perfect place!&quot; he says. &quot;Come on! Everyone out!&quot;
You walk along the coast, before coming to a halt in front of an old rowing boat which your Uncle says was lent to you buy the  toothless old man standing next to him. Everyone hops into the boat, and are soon rowing towards a small, miserable looking shack on a rock in the middle of the ocean.

After reaching the rock, everyone gratefully clambers out of the boat. The shack smells horribly like seaweed. Uncle Vernon, who promised he&apos;d brought rations, turned out to be in possession of four packets of crisps, and four bananas. After eating, he chucks the empty crisp packets into the fire and tries to light it, but they just shrivel up. &quot;Could do with some of those letters now, eh?&quot; he says. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon go into the only other room, and Dudley sleeps on the sofa. You get the floor. You check Dudley&apos;s watch, on his arm which is sticking over the side of the sofa. 

Five minutes to go.

There is another small room to the east.

You can see a the shack&apos;s door (west), sofa, fireplace (empty), blanket and a window (closed) here.

BOOM. The whole shack shivered. You sit bolt upright. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. 
BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. &quot;Where&apos;s the cannon?&quot; he said stupidly. 
There was a crash as Uncle Vernon skidded into the room, holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what was in the package that he had brought with him.
&quot;Who&apos;s there?&quot; he shouted. &quot;I warn you - I&apos;m armed!;
There was a pause. Then -
SMASH!
The door was knocked off of its hinges and landed on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. The giant squeezed his way into the hut. He picked up the door and fitted it back into it&apos;s frame. He turned around to look at them. 
&quot;Couldn&apos;t make us a cup o&quot; tea, could yeh? It&apos;s not been an easy journey...&quot;
 The stranger strolled over to the sofa and told Dudley to move. Dudley instead ran squeaking over to his parents. 
&quot;An here&apos;s Harry!&quot; said the giant.

Shack
There is another small room to the east.

You can see Hagrid, Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, Dudley, a the shack&apos;s door (west), sofa, fireplace (in which is fire), blanket and a window (closed) here.

&quot;I demand that you leave at one, sir!&quot; says Uncle Vernon. &quot;You are breaking and entering!&quot;
The giant wrenched the gun out of Uncle Vernon&apos;s hands, and bent it into a knot, before throwing it aside. 
&quot;I haven&quot; seen you since you was only a baby. I&apos;m Hagrid, by the way. Rubeus Hagrid. I got summat for yeh - it&apos;s in my coat. Here you go.&quot; 

He gives you a box which he removed from his jacket, which, upon opening, contained a large chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. &quot;You wouldn&apos; mind making some tea and sausages, would yeh? they&apos;re in my coat. Start by getting out the tea pot and puttin&apos; some tea leaves in it. Then go to the other room to get some water.&quot; Hagrid bent down in front of the fire, and when he stood up a fire was roaring in the grate.

Second bedroom
The small room in which your aunt and uncle sleep. The door is to the west.

You can see a mouldy old bed (empty) and Dirty sink (in which is water) here.


&gt;[72] fill kettle with water
You must supply a second noun.
You fill the teapot with water. From the other room, Hagrid calls out to you. &quot;How&apos;re you going there, Harry? anyway, I&apos;m the keeper of keys at Hogwarts. Yeh&apos;ll know all about Hogwarts, o&apos; course. 
&quot;Er, no&quot; you call back. &quot;Sorry&quot;.

&quot;Sorry?&quot; barks Hagrid. &quot;It&apos;s them that should be sorry! I knew you weren&apos;t getting the letters, but I still thought you&apos;d know about Hogwarts, fer crying out loud! Didn&apos;t you ever wonder where your parents learnt it all?

&quot;All what?&quot;

&quot;ALL WHAT! Don&apos; you know - Don&apos;t you know anything, about yer parents world?

&quot;What world?

&quot;DURSLEY!&quot; booms Hagrid.

&gt;[73] w
As you enter, Hagrid says &quot;You never told him? You kept it from him for all these years?&quot;

&quot;Kept what from me?&quot; you ask eagerly.

&quot;STOP! I FORBID YOU!&quot; says Uncle Vernon, panicking.

&quot;Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,&quot; says Hagrid. &quot;Harry - yer a wizard.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m a what?&quot; you ask. 
&quot;A wizard, and a good one i&apos;d reckon, once yer trained up a bit. It&apos;s time you read your  letter.&quot; Hagrid hands you a letter.
You unfold the letter and read: 

HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITHCRAFT AND WIZADRY

Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,
Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards

Dear Mr Potter,
    We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
    Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. 

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress.



You look up. &quot;What does it mean, they await my owl?&quot;
Hagrid, appearing to just have his memory jogged, reaches inside one of his coat&apos;s many pockets, and extracts a real, live owl. He also extracts a quill and a roll of parchment. You read the letter he is writing upside down:
Dear Mr Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather&apos;s horrible. Hope you&apos;re well.
Hagrid
He rolls it up, and gives it to the owl, which takes the letter and flies out the window. &quot;Alright Harry, it&apos;d do to get some sleep before tomorrow. Here, use this.&quot; says Hagrid. He gives you his coat to sleep under, which you promptly do. 
You wake next morning.

&gt;[74] look
You keep your eyes screwed shut, knowing that the events of yesterday where a dream. You are at home in your cupboard, waiting for your Aunt to knock on the door. Waiting for her to knock...


&gt;[75] listen
You hear a loud tapping noise. There&apos;s Aunt Petunia, you think, come to wake you up. You wished that yesterday was real, that you really where going off to a wizards school. You open your eyes, to the sight of the dark, damp hut. The tapping is coming from an owl, by the closed window. Hagrid is lying in a corner, snoring loudly.


there&apos;s nothing to hear.


&gt;[76] open window
You open the window, and the owl flies in. The owl drops a newspaper on Hagrid, before beginning to attack Hagrid&apos;s coat. &quot;Hagrid, there&apos;s an owl&quot;, you say. &quot;Pay &apos;im&quot;, responds Hagrid. &quot;There&apos;s money in one o&apos; my coat pockets. Give him five Knuts. They&apos;re the little bronze ones. The Silver ones&apos;re called Sickles, and the gold are Galleons.&quot;

    Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice which made the first noise of the day.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone
Based on by &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s stone&quot; by J.K. Rowling. This game is not approved by J. K. Rowling. It exists because I am a fan of Harry Potter and text adventures, and is not a commercial venture. by Orion Zymaris
Release 1 / Serial number 131210 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD
Cupboard under the stairs
You can see a small, dark room with lots of spiders and your few measly possessions. Not as interesting as the dream you were having - There had been a flying motorbike in it. You have a funny feeling that you&apos;ve had the same dream before...

You can see Cupboard door (south), Bed (empty), a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, some assorted clothing, a chess set and a roll of sellotape here.

You see Dudley here, counting his presents.

You can see kitchen door (east), Uncle Vernon (hiding behind a newspaper), Dudley, a chair, kitchen table (on which is piece of toast), thirty-seven presents, a cooker (on which is a the frying pan (in which are egg and bacon)), fridge (closed) and sink here.

Aunt Petunia enters the kitchen looking angry and worried. &quot;Bad news, Vernon. Mrs Figg&apos;s broken her leg. She can&apos;t take him&quot; she says, jerking her head towards you. Dudley looks horrified. &quot;He&apos;s not coming on my birthday!&quot;

&quot;Maybe you could just leave me here&quot; you suggest. 

&quot;And come back and find the house in ruins?&quot; says Aunt Petunia.

&quot;I won&apos;t blow up the house,&quot; you say.

&quot;I suppose we could take him to the zoo, and leave him in the car,&quot; says Aunt Petunia.
&quot;The car&apos;s new, he&apos;s not sitting in it alone...&quot;
Dudley begins to cry loudly. He&apos;s not really crying, it&apos;s been years since he&apos;s done that, But he knows that Aunt Petunia will give him anything he wants if he does.

That&apos;s the doorbell. Must be Piers Polkiss, Dudley&apos;s friend. Dudley&apos;s stopped pretending to cry.
&quot;Alright, let&apos;s go,&quot; says Petunia. Everyone leaves the kitchen and gets into the Dursley&apos;s car.
