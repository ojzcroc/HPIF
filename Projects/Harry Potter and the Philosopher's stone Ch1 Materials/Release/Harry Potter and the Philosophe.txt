Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,  because they, or rather you, just didn't hold with such nonsense.

As you wake up, on a dull, grey Tuesday, you can hardly imagine that soon strange things would be happening all over the country.
You are Mr  Vernon Dursley, and are in your bedroom.

Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,  because they, or rather you, just didn't hold with such nonsense.
However, they had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.

Mrs Potter, Petunia's sister, and her husband and son, where as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.
