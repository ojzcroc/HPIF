Welcome to An Interactive Fiction version of Harry Potter.
                (If you ever need help, type help.)

When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.

Mrs Dursley goes downstairs and says &quot;You should get ready for work dear!&quot;

Welcome to An Interactive Fiction version of Harry Potter.
                (If you ever need help, type help.)

Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you&apos;d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,  because they, or rather you, just didn&apos;t hold with such nonsense.

As you wake up, on a dull, grey Tuesday, you can hardly imagine that soon strange things would be happening all over the country.
You are Mr  Vernon Dursley, and are in your bedroom.

Dursley&apos;s bedroom (in bed)
You look around. There is a wardrobe, a bed, a bedside table with drawer attached, and a door to the east.

You can see bedroom door (east), bedroom window (providing light), a clock, Wardrobe (closed) and bedside table here.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s stone
Based on &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s stone&quot; by J.K. Rowling. by Orion Zymaris
Release 1 / Serial number 130321 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Welcome to An Interactive Fiction version of Harry Potter.
                (If you ever need help, type help.)

Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you&apos;d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,  because they, or rather you, just didn&apos;t hold with such nonsense.

As you wake up, on a dull, grey Tuesday, you can hardly imagine that soon strange things would be happening all over the country.
You are Mr  Vernon Dursley, and are in your bedroom.

Dursley&apos;s bedroom (in bed)
You look around. There is a wardrobe, a bed, a bedside table with drawer attached, and a door to the east.

You can see bedroom door (east), bedroom window (providing light), a clock, Wardrobe (closed) and bedside table here.

Welcome to An Interactive Fiction version of Harry Potter.
                (If you ever need help, type help.)

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.</result>

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn&apos;t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley&apos;s sister, but they hadn&apos;t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn&apos;t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son too, but they had never seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn&apos;t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.

Mrs Dursley goes downstairs and says &quot;You should get ready for work dear!&quot;

Dear Petunia,
     I hope you respond to this letter. I would really like to keep in touch! Three months since I went to Hogwarts for the
first time and already I feel like an old timer. I&apos;m still wary of some of the teachers we have though. Some of them are
downright horrible. There are also some real show-offs here too. James Potter is the most boisterous of them, but his
friend Sirius is pretty self-centered too. On the other hand, the rest of his friends aren&apos;t bad. Remus Lupin is rather
kind, and his friend Peter Pettigrew is quite well mannered, if frustratingly shy.
The world of magic is amazing, and there&apos;s so much to do! We

&quot;And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation&apos;s owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.

Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern. Most mysterious.

And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?&quot;.</result>

&quot;Well, Ted, I don&apos;t know about that, but it&apos;s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they&apos;ve had a downpour of shooting stars!
Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it&apos;s not untill next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.

As you sit there thinking about your day, Petunia comes into the room, carrying a tray with 2 cups of tea.&quot;Here&apos;s your tea, Vernon&quot;.

&quot;Er - Petunia, dear - you haven&apos;t heard from your sister lately, have you?&quot;

&quot;No. Why?&quot; Says Petunia, rather sharply.

You can see the bedroom door (northwest), bedroom window (providing light), bed (empty), a clock, Wardrobe (in which are Pyjamas, a mirror, wizards robes, a suit and a tutu) and bedside table here.

&gt;[104] look window
As you look out the window, you see the cat from this morning, as well as a tall, thin man, who silently walks from the corner of the street. He holds up a small object, and suddenly, all the lamps in the street go out.

Today&apos;s been a bit tiring. You should get to bed.

&gt;[105] get in bed
As you climb into bed, you hear slight mutterings from outside, and the sound of a motorbike.</result>
